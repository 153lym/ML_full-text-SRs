Abstract  In the presence of heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE), the average treatment effect from a  randomized controlled trial (RCT) may not be applicable to different patients, such as those in  observational settings. Our objective was to develop a novel approach that uses individual-level  simulation to expand RCT results to target patient populations in the presence of HTE. For this purpose,  we compared the results of the Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy (RE-LY)  trial, and two observational studies that compared benefits and risks of dabigatran to warfarin in patients  with atrial fibrillation. We developed a simulation model that replicates the rates of ischemic stroke and  major bleeding observed in RE-LY using published outcome risk models and participants’ baseline  characteristics. We used our validated simulation model to predict what the results of the RCT would  have been had it been conducted in populations similar to those in the observational studies.             Keywords: Heterogeneity of Treatment Effects; Discrete Event Simulation; Generalizability;  Anticoagulants    Word Count: 3872  Accepted Article               Introduction  Randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) are usually considered as the gold standard for assessing  treatment efficacy.1 Random assignment of patients to different treatments can yield unbiased estimates of  treatment effect for the population under study. Observational studies can complement RCTs by capturing  rare adverse events and long-term outcomes that are critical for informing patient-centered treatment  decisions, but are not usually available in RCTs.1  Observational studies can also provide outcome  estimates of treatment effectiveness in broad patient populations in actual practice settings, rather than in  narrow RCT populations in protocol directed experimental settings.    The results of observational studies often differ from those of RCTs.2, 3 Such discrepancies can arise from  several sources, including confounding bias in the observational study, differences in outcome  measurement, differences in follow-up, differences in adherence, and from differences in patient  characteristics (Table 1) that modify the treatment effect, known as heterogeneity of treatment effect  (HTE). In the absence of HTE, results of RCTs should, in expectation, generalize to other patient  populations provided that doses, adherence, and durations of treatment are similar.4  However, in the  presence of HTE, the average treatment effect from the RCT may not be applicable to many patients who  use the treatments in typical care settings.5   Accepted Article     We propose a novel approach to expand RCT results to broader patient populations in the presence of  HTE. The approach uses an individual-level simulation and evidence about HTE derived from the RCT to  estimate effects applicable to the characteristics of external patient populations.      Results  Replication of RCT results  The simulation model (Figure S1) successfully replicated the overall results of RE-LY (Table 2). The  simulation model predicted rates of stroke/SE of 1.13 and 1.74, ischemic stroke of 0.94 and 1.23 ICH of  0.32 and 0.76, and major bleeding of 3.34 and 3.58 per 100 person years for dabigatran and warfarin  groups, respectively.  These estimates closely matched the observed rates in RE-LY. The HRs and 95%  credible intervals (CIs) obtained from the simulation model also matched the HRs from RE-LY (Table 2).  Modeling error, defined as the difference between observed and predicted results of RE-LY, could have  been caused by misspecification of simulation model structure or assumptions about input parameters,  especially misclassification of risk strata based on CHADS2 subgroups.      Counterfactual results of RE-LY in the Graham 2014 population  We generated cohorts of equal size and with similar covariate distributions as those in the Graham 2014  study. The simulation model predicted rates of ischemic stroke of 1.13 and 1.45 (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.61- 1.02), rates of ICH of 0.37 and 0.83 (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.26-0.69), and rates of major bleeding of 3.85  and 3.92 per 100 person years (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.83-1.15) in dabigatran and warfarin groups,  respectively (Table 2). These results suggested that the slightly higher rates of ischemic stroke (1.13 and  1.39 in dabigatran and warfarin, respectively) and ICH (0.33 and 0.96 in dabigatran and warfarin,  Accepted Article     respectively) observed in Graham 2014 compared to RE-LY, can be almost entirely explained by  differences in patients’ baseline characteristics. Rates of stroke/SE were not reported in Graham et al  study, but were predicted to be 1.37 and 2.04 in dabigatran and warfarin groups (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52- 0.87), respectively, using our simulation model.   The model predicted higher rates of major bleeding in the Graham 2014 population (3.85 and 3.92 in  dabigatran and warfarin, respectively) compared to the RE-LY population. Predicted rates were smaller  than corresponding observed rates in Graham 2014 (4.27 and 4.39 in dabigatran and warfarin,  respectively). This suggests that differences in rates of major bleeding between RE-LY and Graham et al  could be only partially attributed to differences in study populations. However, the predicted (HR, 0.98;  95% CI, 0.83-1.15) and observed (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.88-1.07) HRs for major bleeding were similar.      We also examined discrepancies on the difference measure scale between the results of Graham 2014 and  RE-LY by comparing risk differences in ischemic stroke, ICH, and major bleeding. We determined the  contribution of HTE, modeling error, and unexplained discrepancies to explain these between study  differences (Figure 1). For example, Figure 1a indicates how HTE, modeling error, and unexplained  components add up to explain discrepancy between the observed risk difference of ischemic stroke in  Graham 2014 (RD, -0.26) and the observed risk difference in RE-LY (RD, -0.28). Note that, the sum of  HTE, modeling error, and unexplained component for a given outcome equals the discrepancy between  the observed risk difference in RE-LY and the observed risk difference for that outcome in Graham 2014.  Figure 1c also suggests that a substantial amount of discrepancy in major bleeding results between  Graham 2014 and RE-LY can be explained by HTE. Figure S2 demonstrates discrepancies between  predicted and observed estimates of risk difference in ischemic stroke and major bleeding in a benefit risk  plane. We also have presented the joint distribution of predicted risk differences in Figure S3.    Accepted Article     Counterfactual results of RE-LY in Larsen 2013 population  When we changed the baseline characteristics of the simulated cohort to match those in Larsen 2013 and  repeated the simulation, predicted rates of ischemic stroke were 0.66 and 0.91 per 100 person years for  dabigatran and warfarin groups, respectively (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.50-1.04) (Table 2). In contrast,  observed rates of ischemic stroke were 3.5 and 3.0 (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.85-1.64) in Larsen 2013. The  predicted ICH rates were 0.66 and 0.91, respectively, (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.50-1.04) in a population with  characteristics similar to those in Larsen 2013, whereas the observed rates were 0.1 and 0.7, respectively  (HR, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.01-0.40).   The predicted rates of major bleeding were 2.51 and 3.06, respectively, (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.67-1.01) in  a population similar to the Larsen 2013. These predicted rates were slightly larger but comparable to  observed rates of 2.2 and 2.9 (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.51-1.13). Figure 1a indicates how HTE, modeling  error, and unexplained components add up to explain the discrepancy between the observed ischemic  stroke risk difference in Larsen 2013 (RD, 0.5) and in RE-LY (RD, -0.28).  Figure 1a suggests that the  discrepancy between the observed risk difference for ischemic stroked in Larsen 2013 and RE-LY is  mainly due to unexplained component. Figure 1c suggests that a substantial portion of the discrepancy  between the observed Larsen 2013 results and the RE-LY results is due to HTE.       Discussion  Observational studies using databases of routinely collected health information can be useful for  examining whether the benefits and risks of treatments found in RCTs apply also to populations of  patients treated in routine care settings.  Paradoxically, however, doubt about the validity of the  observational studies often arises when they yield results that are discrepant with randomized  investigations. These comparisons, however, often ignore between study-population differences and the  Accepted Article     impact that they can have on the results in the presence of HTE. We propose a simulation method to  predict the counterfactual outcomes of a randomized trial had it been conducted in a target observational  study population. We used the approach to estimate predicted outcomes of the RE-LY trial in populations  similar to two observational studies and quantified how much of the differences in results could be  explained by HTE as a result of different study populations versus other differences between the studies,  such as bias or differences in outcome definitions, adherence, or follow-up duration.   Our results suggest that differences in the rates of ischemic stroke, ICH, and major bleeding between the  RE-LY trial and Graham 2014 were largely explained by differences in study populations. However,  observed differences between rates of stroke and ICH outcomes in RE-LY and Larsen 2013 could not be  explained by differences in study populations. In particular, the difference in rates of ischemic stroke  between the RE-LY trial and Larsen 2013 became larger after accounting for differences in study  populations.  This suggested that, factors other than study population differences, such as confounding or  misclassification of outcomes, likely explain the differences in rates of outcomes.6   We also examined discrepancies in treatment effect sizes between studies by comparing rate differences  for ischemic stroke, ICH, and major bleeding. Our results suggest that discrepancies in ischemic stroke  rate differences between Larsen 2013 and the RE-LY trial remained after adjusting for differences  between study populations indicating that the observed differences are likely due to factors other than  HTE. However, discrepancies in rate differences for major bleeding could be largely explained by HTE  due to differences in study populations.    Although many factors can contribute to differences in between study results, here we have focused on  differences resulted from HTE and variation in study populations. Study populations are rarely the same  across different studies. In most situations, baseline covariates (e.g. age, history of stroke) are also risk  factors for the outcomes that are being studied and therefore, they can differentially influence outcome  Accepted Article     event rates across different patient populations. In the presence of HTE, baseline covariates can influence  treatment effect size measured in different patients. Therefore, differences in study populations can result  in variation in estimated rates and treatment effect sizes across different studies. Our proposed method  provides an approximate approach to estimate the magnitude of this impact on study results. Selection  bias, information bias, and confounding remain challenging issues in observational studies in routinely  collected databases. Although by using methods such as propensity scoring or stratification we can reduce  measured confounding in observational studies, residual confounding due to unmeasured covariates may  not be fully addressed by using these methods. Information bias, which is caused by misclassification of  outcomes, exposures, or covariates, also can distort study results, especially in observational studies  where adjudication of outcomes are not feasible. Sampling variation (chance), even if the samples were  drawn from the same patient population, could also result in between study differences. However, the  variation in the point estimates due to random sampling is expected to be captured in the reported  confidence intervals.    To our knowledge, this is the first study that used simulation to predict counterfactual outcomes of a  randomized trial that are applicable to a different target population in the presence of heterogeneity of  treatment effect. This simulation method can be applied in the context of any other treatment or health  condition. Cole at al 7 proposed using inverse probability-of-selection weights as a method to generalize  inferences from a randomized trial to a specified target population. Using this method they demonstrated  that the effect of a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment from a randomized trial would be  12% smaller in the target population of US people infected with HIV in 2006. The method re-weights the  randomized trial results to provide standardized estimates of treatment effect in a target population. An  important practical limitation of this method and of related standardization approaches8 (e.g., standardized  mortality ratios), which use strata-specific estimates and combines them using a weighted average based  on covariate distributions of a target population, is that it requires knowing the joint distribution of effect  Accepted Article     modifiers in the target population, which may not always be available or obtainable.  In contrast, our  proposed approach provides an alternative method that builds on outcome prediction models to project a  wide range of outcomes and measures such as rates, relative risks, and risk differences in a target  population. This is particularly useful when the goal is between study comparison of rates for multiple  outcomes, treatment effect sizes, and decomposing sources of discrepant results. Basu and colleagues9  estimated counterfactual distribution of blood pressure in a certain population (e.g. blacks) if its risk  factor profile (e.g. body mass index, sodium intake, and alcohol use) looked like a comparator population  (blacks). Their approach was based on Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition method that has been used to  decompose sources of difference in outcomes in different populations using regression analysis.10 Our  work is also closely related to recent literature about transportability in epidemiology. Methods such as  do-calculus try developed in this area aim to assess external validity and applicability of experimental  results in different target populations. In particular, methods such as do-calculus provide formal  discussion about the necessary conditions under those transporting experimental results to a target  population is valid.   We presented our proposed approach by showing how an individual-level simulation and evidence about  heterogeneity of treatment effect can be derived from a randomized trial to estimate effects applicable to  the characteristics of “real-world” patient populations.  This may be especially useful in the early phase  after drug approval when physicians, decision makers, and payors speculate about the extent to which  treatment effect is applicable to different target populations. Application of the proposed method can also  be generalized to adjust between-study population differences when comparing two or more observational  studies as long as an outcome prediction model is developed and validated in one of the studies.    Several limitations of the proposed method as well as the particular case studies used should be  mentioned. The accuracy of the model was limited by lack of availability of multivariable outcome  prediction models. Specifically, in the absence of individual-level trial data, the model relied on the  Accepted Article     results of an analysis that reported only risk of outcomes based on three levels of patients’ CHADS2  scores. Having access to patient-level RCT data may have allowed us develop and validate more accurate  outcome prediction models. Rilley et al have conducted a follow-on analysis of RE-LY data to predict  risk of ischemic stroke/SE and major bleeding based on a number of patient characteristics.11 Although  their models were more complex, they were only reported for the dabigatran arm, precluding us from  using it to estimate outcome rates among both dabigatran and warfarin users. However, we conducted an  ad hoc analysis using the prediction models reported in Rilley et al to evaluate our simulation model for  dabigatran users (Table S1). As with our primary model, this alternative model also successfully  replicated the dabigatran outcome rates in RE-LY. Also in line with the results of our primary analysis,  these predicted rates suggested that discrepancies in the rates of ischemic stroke between RE-LY and  Larsen et al could not be explained based on differences in study population and are most likely indicative  of bias in the observational study. Potential errors in measurement of covariates and outcomes using  observational data is another limitation in implementing this approach. Unlike RCTs, covariates and  outcomes in observational studies are captured using data that are not typically recorded for research  purposes.12 For example, outcomes and covariates in Graham 2014 were derived from Medicare billing  information while Larsen 2013 used hospital records. Therefore, some of the unexplained differences,  particularly between RE-LY and Larsen 2013, could be due to variation in measurement of covariates and  outcomes. One possible solution to this problem can be achieved by linking RCTs to observational  studies. This type of linkage would create “information overlap” that could be used for calibrating  measurement using observational data sources.12       Our approach is based on the assumption that the outcome prediction models developed based on RCT  data can correctly and fully describe the relationships between covariates, treatment, and outcomes. If the  prediction model is mis-specified, such as by omitting effect modifiers or interactions among variables  that led to HTE, the simulated outcomes in the target cohort may differ from those of the RCT.  Accepted Article     Developing outcome prediction models requires having access to either outcome prediction models or to  patient-level RCT data to estimate such statistical models. Nascent initiatives encouraging open access to  individual level RCT data13, 14 can facilitate developing more precise simulation models and, therefore,  wider application of this method for understanding HTE between studies and populations. Dahabereh and  colleagues15 provide a concise discussion about benefits of using multivariate outcome prediction models  rather than conventional ‘one-variable-at-a-time’ subgroup analyses. Studies conducted by Burke et al16,  Kent et al17, and Rilley et al11 demonstrate how multivariate outcomes prediction models based on  individual level trial data can be used to capture heterogeneity of treatment effect. Multivariate outcome  prediction models can be developed and validated using a wide range of techniques, including  conventional regression models or machine learning techniques such as causal forest models.18         Overall, we demonstrated that, in the presence of heterogeneity of treatment effect, differences in patient  populations can explain a substantial portion of observed differences in outcomes across studies. Our  proposed method, which leverages individual-level RCT data and uses an individual-level simulation  model, can adjust for differences between populations and provide counterfactual outcomes of an RCT in  a target population. Application of this method can facilitate interpretation of between study variations in  results and can support deriving better informed inferences about true underlying treatment effect.         Materials and Methods  Selected case studies  We selected as a case study the Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy (RE-LY)  trial, a large RCT that compared the efficacy and safety of dabigatran and warfarin in patients with atrial  Accepted Article     fibrillation.19 We compared the RE-LY results with the results of two observational studies (Graham 2014  and Larsen 2013) that aimed at assessing the effectiveness and safety of dabigatran versus warfarin for  treatment of atrial fibrillation in routine care. 20, 21 We chose this case study because HTE was observed in  the RE-LY trial, a model examining modifiers of the treatment effect was available, and because several  observational studies have examined similar outcomes.  Table 1 summarizes the baseline characteristics of patients in three studies.  The main observed results of  RE-LY trial and those of Graham 2014 and Larsen 2013 are summarized in Table 2. The median duration  of the follow-up period was 2 years in RE-LY; dabigatran-treated and warfarin-treated patients  contributed 12,042 and 11,796 person-years to the study, respectively. In Graham-2014 study, dabigatran- treated and warfarin-treated patients contributed 18,205 and 19,382 person-years, respectively. The  median follow-up time in Larsen-2013 was 10.5 months and study included 4,086 person-years of  dabigatran-treated patients.   All incidence rates in Graham 2014 are higher than those from the RE-LY trial although the hazard ratios  (HRs) were similar and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) largely overlapped. For example, rates of  ischemic stroke in Graham 2014 were 1.13 and 1.39 per 100 person years for patients on dabigatran and  warfarin (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67-0.96), respectively, compared to 0.92 and 1.20 per 100 person years  (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60 -0.98) in RE-LY.   In contrast, the estimated incidence rates and HRs from Larsen 2013 differed substantially from the  corresponding rates and HRs from the RE-LY trial. For example, incidence rates of ischemic stroke were  3.5 and 3.0 per 100 person years (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.85-1.64) for patients treated with dabigatran and  warfarin, respectively, compared to 0.92 and 1.20 per 100 person years (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60 - 0.98) in  RE-LY.   Simulation model  Accepted Article     We first developed a discrete event simulation model that used published outcomes rates from the RE-LY  trial 22 as well as data on patients’ baseline characteristics from RE-LY19 to replicate the RCT results  (Figure S1).  Building the simulation model involved three main steps: (1) using a Monte Carlo  simulation to generate hypothetical cohorts of patients with baseline covariate distributions that matched  the marginal distribution of covariates in the RE-LY population; (2) designing a model structure based on  apriori knowledge about possible pathways and health states that patients may experience over time; and  (3) defining the relationship between patient-level baseline covariates (e.g., patient characteristics, event  histories, treatment assignment) and the risk of outcomes based on published outcome risk models.    For the main analysis, the relations between patient level covariates and the outcomes of stroke/SE,  ischemic stroke, ICH, and major bleeding were modeled using CHADS2-specific outcomes rates reported  by Oldgren et al.22 Oldgren et al published follow-on analysis of RE-LY that estimated rates of stroke and  thromboembolism, intracranial hemorrhage, and major bleeding based on trial participants’ CHADS2  scores. 22 The CHADS2 score is a simple, validated measure of risk that assigns two points for a history  of stroke or transient ischemic attack, and one point for having a history of congestive heart failure,  hypertension, age 75 years or older, and diabetes. Using RE-LY trial data, Oldgren et al demonstrated that  risk of thromboembolic and bleeding events varies by patients’ CHADS2 score (Table S2). The results  suggested increasing rates of thrombotic and bleeding events and corresponding hazard ratios for higher  categories of CHADS2 score. We used these results to predict risk of stroke and thromboembolism,  intracranial bleeding, and major bleeding, given patients’ characteristics in our simulation model. Possible  health states and pathways in the model were defined based on a priori clinical knowledge about possible  outcomes of patients with atrial fibrillation treated using anticoagulants.  Comparison of predicted RCT results to observed RCT results  Accepted Article     We simulated hypothetical cohorts of 6,000 warfarin patients and 6,000 dabigatran patients with the  marginal covariate distributions and sample size similar to those of the patients in the RE-LY trial (Table  3).  The simulation model estimated predicted outcomes of RCT patients (𝑂̂𝑖 𝑅𝐶𝑇) conditional on their  characteristics (𝐶𝑖 𝑅𝐶𝑇), assuming that the outcome prediction models and model structure accurately  reflected the true relationship between covariates and outcomes: 𝑂̂𝑖 𝑅𝐶𝑇 = 𝑓(𝐶𝑖 𝑅𝐶𝑇), where 𝑂̂𝑖 𝑅𝐶𝑇 is the  expected outcome of interest, 𝐶𝑖 𝑅𝐶𝑇 is a vector of covariates for patient i in the RCT, and f represents all  model assumptions that defined the relationship between patient level covariates and outcomes.      To validate the discrete event simulation model, we compared the expected outcomes (𝑂̂𝑖 𝑅𝐶𝑇) with the  observed RCT outcomes (𝑂𝑅𝐶𝑇).  If the model structure, f, is specified correctly, the model will  accurately replicate the overall RCT outcomes (𝑂𝑅𝐶𝑇) for a cohort of patients similar to RCT participants.  We defined modeling error as the difference between observed and predicted results of RCT (i.e.,  𝑂𝑅𝐶𝑇 − 𝑂̂𝑅𝐶𝑇) for each particular outcome (Table S4).  Comparison of predicted observational results to observed RCT results  Next, we simulated predicted outcomes for patients in the observational studies. We used the discrete  event simulation model developed and validated among RCT patients to estimate expected outcomes in  the observational study populations: 𝑂̂𝑂𝑏𝑠 = 𝑓(𝐶𝑂𝑏𝑠). This was done by changing the baseline  characteristics of the simulated cohort to match marginal distribution of the patients’ characteristics in  each of the observational studies. For each of those observational studies, we simulated hypothetical  cohorts of 6,000 warfarin patients and 6,000 dabigatran patients. As such, the simulated outcomes  (𝑂̂𝑂𝑏𝑠) can be interpreted as the results of the RCT had it been conducted in a population similar to that  in the observational study.  HTE was defined to be equal to the difference between predicted result of  Accepted Article     RCT and predicted result of observational study [𝑂̂𝑅𝐶𝑇 −  𝑂̂ 𝑂𝑏𝑠]. This component reflects variation in  results that are likely caused by the differences in study populations.  Comparison of predicted observational results to observed observational results   We also defined the difference between predicted and observed results of observational studies [𝑂̂𝑂𝑏𝑠 − 𝑂𝑂𝑏𝑠] as unexplained discrepancies. Based on this definition, all discrepancies between observed results  of RCT and observed results of observational studies that could not be explained by modeling error or  HTE were defined as unexplained discrepancies. Therefore, unexplained discrepancies include factors  such as confounding, misclassification of outcomes, differences in outcomes and risk factors  measurement, differences in follow-up, and differences in adherence in RCT versus electronic databases.  Note that based on this definition, modeling error, HTE, and unexplained components add up to be equal  to differences between observed results of RCT an observational studies. These notations and concepts  have been summarized in Table 3.      Patient involvement  No patients were involved in this study. Defining the research question and the outcomes, study design,  implementation, interpretation, and reporting of the results were done solely by study investigators.         Study Highlights  o What is the current knowledge on the topic? The results of observational studies often differ from  those of RCTs.  One possible explanation is that in the presence of heterogeneity of treatment effect  Accepted Article     (HTE), the average treatment effect from a randomized clinical trial (RCT) may not be applicable to  different patients, such as those in observational studies.   o What question did this study address? Our objective was to quantify the differences between RCT  and observational studies that can be explained by the differences in study populations.   o What does this study add to our knowledge? We proposed a novel approach that uses individual- level simulation to predict what the results of the RCT would have been had it been conducted in  populations similar to those in the observational studies.   o How might this change clinical pharmacology or translational science? Application of this method  can facilitate interpretation of between study variations in results and can support deriving better informed  inferences about true underlying treatment effect.

This study (NCT02503202) evaluated the safety of recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus–Zaire Ebola virus enve- lope glycoprotein vaccine (rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP). Methods. Overall, 1197 subjects were randomized 2:2:2:2:1; 1194 were vaccinated with 1 dose of 1 of 3 lots of rVSVΔG-  ZEBOV-GP (2 × 107 plaque-forming units [pfu], n = 797; combined-lots group), a single high-dose lot of rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP   (1 × 108 pfu, n = 264; high-dose group), or placebo (n = 133). Daily temperatures and adverse events (AEs) were recorded days 1 to 42  postvaccination. Solicited AEs included injection-site AEs from days 1 to 5, and joint pain, joint swelling, vesicular lesions (blisters),  and rashes from days 1 to 42. Serious AEs (SAEs) were recorded through 6 months postvaccination. Results. Fever (≥38.0°C) was observed in 20.2% of combined lots (3.2% with ≥39.0°C), 32.2% of high-dose (4.3% with ≥39.0°C),  and 0.8% of placebo (0.8% with ≥39.0°C). Incidences of AEs of interest (days 1–42) were arthralgia (17.1% combined lots, 20.4%  high-dose, 3.0% placebo), arthritis (5.1% combined lots, 4.2% high-dose, 0.0% placebo), and rash (3.8% combined lots, 3.8% high- dose, 1.5% placebo). Twenty-one SAEs and 2 deaths were reported, all assessed by investigators as unrelated to vaccine. Conclusions. rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP was generally well-tolerated, with increased rates of injection-site and systemic AEs com- pared to placebo, and no vaccine-related SAEs or deaths. These findings support the use of rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine in persons  at risk for Ebola virus disease. Clinical Trials Registration. NCT02503202. Keywords. rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP; Ebola; vaccine; safety.   Ebola viruses (EBOV) are members of the Filoviridae family  and cause hemorrhagic fevers with high mortality [1]. Until  recently, EBOV caused relatively small outbreaks in rural  Central and East Africa but was associated with very high mor- tality rates. Prior to 2014, there were approximately 15 EBOV  outbreaks reported, mostly with several to a few hundred cases  [1, 2]. The recent outbreak (2014–2016) of EBOV in West Africa  greatly surpassed all previous outbreaks combined in the  number of cases, the number of deaths, the geographic extent,  and the disruption of national healthcare systems, economies,  and civil society [2]. From December 2013 until March 2015,  >28 600 cases with at least 11 300 deaths (40% mortality) were  reported, primarily from Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea.  Although several EBOV vaccines were under development  prior to the West Africa outbreak, its size and scope catalyzed  an international effort to accelerate development and testing of  EBOV vaccines in an unprecedented manner [2]. One such EBOV vaccine uses a recombinant vesicular sto- matitis virus (rVSV) as a vector to elicit an immune response  against the Zaire EBOV (ZEBOV; Kikwit strain) glycoprotein  (rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP) [3]. VSV normally infects cattle, pigs,  and horses, causing mucosal lesions; humans rarely become  infected and, when they do, are usually asymptomatic, although  febrile influenza-like symptoms and (rarely) mucosal and  skin lesions can occur [4]. In rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP, the gene  encoding the VSV surface glycoprotein is replaced with the  gene encoding the ZEBOV glycoprotein, further attenuating  the virus [5]. This construct (rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP) has been  shown to be immunogenic in rodents and in nonhuman pri- mates and highly effective when given preexposure in nonhu- man primates [5–7].

Atotal of 8 phase 1 clinical trials were undertaken and have  demonstrated rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP to be generally well-tol- erated and immunogenic in humans [5–7]. Based on these  studies, 4 large, phase 2/3 clinical trials were initiated to demon- strate safety, immunogenicity, and where possible, efficacy. This  randomized, double-blind, multicenter phase 3 clinical trial  (NCT02503202) was undertaken to examine the lot-to-lot con- sistency of rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP and provide further safety  and immunogenicity data. The observation of a relatively high  incidence of arthritis in one of the phase 1 sites prompted us to  design the study in such a way that detailed information was  collected about the incidence, onset, and duration of arthralgia,  arthritis, and rash in a large, well-controlled study [6,7]. We  report here the preplanned, interim 6-month safety analysis. METHODS Design This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled  study conducted at 40 sites in the United States, 1 site in Spain,  and 1 site in Canada, between 17 August 2015 and 2 May  2016. A total of 1197 healthy adults were randomized (1194  vaccinated) to receive 1 of 3 consistency lots of rVSVΔG-   ZEBOV-GP vaccine (2×107 plaque-forming units [pfu]), a high  dose of rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine (1×108 pfu), or placebo  in a 2:2:2:2:1 ratio. This would result in 250 subjects in each  vaccine group, and 125 subjects in placebo with the targeted  total enrollment of 1125 subjects. The study will continue in a  subpopulation of subjects among the US sites (N=565) until  2years after vaccination to collect long-term safety and immu- nogenicity data. At the time of writing this manuscript, the gly- coprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (gpELISA) and  the plaque-reduction neutralization titer test were still in the  process of being validated, and the immunogenicity data of this  study will be the subject of a separate manuscript. Study Procedures A vaccine report card (VRC) was distributed at visit 1 and  reviewed with each subject. Injection-site reactions (including  swelling, redness, and pain/tenderness) were recorded daily  by the subject from days 1 to 5 postvaccination. Oral tempera- tures and systemic and/or injection-site adverse events (AEs)  were recorded by the subject from days 1 to 42 postvaccination.  Arthralgia (joint pain), arthritis (joint swelling), rashes, and  vesicular lesions (blisters) were prompted on the VRC to be  recorded by the subject from days 1 to 42 postvaccination. From  the end of visit 3 (day 42) through visit 4 (month 6), only seri- ous AEs (SAEs) and recurrences of events of arthralgia/arthri- tis, rash, and/or vesicular lesions were collected. Safety was  evaluated for all subjects through 6 months postvaccination,  including 42 days of solicited AEs. AE intensity was to be  assessed as mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tol- erated), moderate (discomfort enough to cause interference  with usual activity), or severe (incapacitating with inability to  work or do usual activity). Injection-site redness or swelling  from the day of vaccination through day 5 postvaccination was  evaluated by maximum size. Subjects who experienced arthralgia, arthritis, rash, or  vesicular lesions at any time through 42days postvaccination  were instructed to immediately contact the investigative site.  Based on the symptoms, subjects were to be brought back for  unscheduled examinations, to potentially include a dermatol- ogy or rheumatology consultation, and collection of specimens  (synovial fluid, vesicular fluid, and skin biopsies) to be tested  for the presence of the vaccine virus via real-time polymerase  chain reaction (PCR; details are shown in the Supplementary  Materials). In accordance with principles of Good Clinical Practice,  written informed consent was obtained from each partici- pant prior to study entry. Additional consent was obtained  for the collection of specimens at the rheumatology/derma- tology site. The protocol was approved by the human studies  committees at each research site. All study assessments were  conducted in a blinded manner; unblinding occurred after  database lock. Population Healthy subjects 18–65 years old were eligible for the study  (inclusion/exclusion criteria are shown in the Supplementary  Materials). Participants were advised to avoid pregnancy by  means of appropriate contraceptive methods. Vaccine The rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine is a live attenuated recom- binant vaccine (details are shown in the Supplementary  Materials). Vaccine (3 consistency lots of rVSVΔG-   ZEBOV-GP vaccine [2 × 107 pfu] and 1 lot of high-dose  rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine [1 × 108 pfu]) was stored at ≤  –70°C with the vaccine thawed and administered within 15  minutes after thawing. Placebo (0.9% normal saline) was stored  at room temperature. Subjects were vaccinated with 1.0mL of  study vaccine/placebo intramuscularly in the deltoid muscle of  the nondominant arm using a 3.0-mL polypropylene syringe  and 23-gauge needle. Randomization A double-blind/masking technique was used. The rVSVΔG-  ZEBOV-GP vaccine and placebo were prepared and dispensed  by an unblinded pharmacist or qualified trial site personnel. The  subject, the investigator, and personnel involved in the vaccine  administration or clinical evaluation were blinded. Treatment  allocation/randomization occurred centrally using an inter- active voice response system using a computer-generated,  Safety Data of Ebola Zaire Vaccine • JID 2017:XX (XX XXXX) • 3 site-balanced allocation schedule. Treatment allocation/ randomization was stratified according to age (18–45 and  46–65years). Statistical Analysis All randomized participants who were vaccinated and had  safety follow-up were included in the safety analysis and  included in the group for the treatment they actually received.  The primary safety objective was to determine the safety and  tolerability of rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine from 3 consistency  lot groups (A, B, and C, each separately and combined) and the  high-dose group through 42days postvaccination. An explor- atory objective examined the safety and tolerability for SAEs  through 6months postvaccination. The AEs and fever profiles were described for the study vac- cine after each vaccination and for the entire vaccination period.  AEs are summarized with counts, percentages, and, when pro- vided, exact 95% CIs (Clopper-Pearson method). Comparisons  of rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP to placebo are reported with 95% CIs  calculated using the Miettinen and Nurminen method [8].  Nominal P values were provided for informative purposes, not  for hypothesis testing. All data were fully reviewed, source document verified, and  no data queries were outstanding at the time of the database  lock. However, as this study is continuing until 2years postvacci- nation, data are subject to change pending further information. Sample Size andPower The sample size for this study (planned 250 subjects per  lot) was determined to show consistency of immunoge- nicity between the 3 lots of rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP with 99%  power assuming 10% dropouts; the standard deviation on  the log-scale of the gpELISA geometric mean titer (GMT) of  1 (estimated from 3 phase 1 studies); and the true gpELISA  GMT ratio between any 2 lots of 1, and equivalence margins  of 0.5-fold and 2.0-fold. With a planned sample size of 750  rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP (250 × 3 consistency lot groups) and  125 planned placebo subjects, there was 80% power to detect  4% vs 0% AEs, respectively. RESULTS Participant Accounting and Demographics Overall, 1197 subjects were randomized 2:2:2:2:1 to receive  either a single vaccination of 1 of 3 consistency lots of rVSVΔG-  ZEBOV-GP (2×107 pfu), a high dose of rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP  (1×108 pfu), or placebo. Atotal of 1194 (99.7%) subjects were  vaccinated and 1138 (95.1%) completed the study (Figure1).  The reasons for the 56 discontinuations were as follows: lost to  follow-up (35), withdrawal (18), death (2), and physician deci- sion (1). The baseline characteristics were comparable among  groups (Table1). AdverseEvents Safety follow-up information was obtained in 1183 of 1194  (99.1%) vaccinated subjects. Overall, 81%–85% of participants  in the vaccine groups reported ≥1 AE postvaccination com- pared with 44% of placebo recipients (Table2). In general, the  proportion of participants reporting injection-site and systemic  AEs were higher in the vaccine groups compared to the pla- cebo group and similar between the vaccine groups. The inci- dence of injection-site related events was 70.8% vs 13.5% and  the incidence of systemic AEs was 63.2% vs 35.6% in the vac- cine and placebo groups, respectively (Table2). Table3 displays  the proportion of subjects with VRC-prompted injection-site  AEs (incidence >0% in ≥1 vaccination group) and Table4 dis- plays systemic AEs (incidence ≥4 subjects in ≥1 group; day 1  to month 6)that were statistically significantly different in ≥1  vaccine group from placebo. Most of these reports were mild  to moderate in intensity. The percentage of subjects in the com- bined lots group, high-dose group, and placebo group with  severe injection site–related events was 2.8%, 2.7%, and 0.0%,  respectively, and for severe systemic AEs was 10.3%, 13.5%, and  1.5% respectively (Tables 3 and 4). Pain was the most frequent  reported injection-site related event (up to 70%) and pyrexia the  most common systemic event (up to 29%). Fever of any degree  postvaccination was more common in the high-dose group  (32.2% had fever ≥38.0°C and 4.3% ≥39.0°C) than the com- bined lots group (20.2% had fever ≥38.0°C and 3.2% ≥39.0°C),  and both vaccine groups reported higher rates of fever as com- pared to the placebo group (0.8% had fever ≥38.0°C and 0.8%  ≥39.0°C) (Table5). All SAEs between day 1 and month 6 after  vaccination are presented in Supplementary Table1, and all sys- temic AEs with an incidence ≥2% in ≥1 group between day 1  and month 6 after vaccination are presented in Supplementary  Table2. Rash, Arthritis, and Arthralgia Higher rates of rash were observed in the combined lots group  (3.8%) and high-dose group (3.8%) compared to the placebo  group (1.5%), but the differences between groups did not reach  statistical significance. In total, 18 of 1050 (1.7%) cases of arthritis (Medical  Dictionary for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA] preferred  terms arthritis [n = 15], monoarthritis [n = 1], osteoarthritis  [n=1], and polyarthritis [n=1]) were reported in the vaccine  group and none in the placebo group. Most subjects with arthri- tis had ≥1 affected joint (12/18). Using a broader definition for  arthritis by adding the MedDRA preferred terms joint swelling  and joint effusion, the number of subjects with arthritis events  increased to 51 (4.9%). Arthralgia and arthritis (broader defini- tion) were reported at a statistically higher rate in the vaccine  groups than in placebo recipients (Table6). In the combined  lots, high-dose, and placebo groups, the incidence of arthralgia  4 • JID 2017:XX (XX XXXX) • Halperin etal was 17.1%, 20.4%, and 3.0%, respectively; and for arthritis was  5.1%, 4.2%, and 0%, respectively. The onset of arthralgia was usually in the first week postvac- cination (median, 2 days), of short duration (median, 3 days),  and part of a syndrome of multiple early events such as fever,  headache, and myalgia. The onset of arthritis was usually in the  second week postvaccination (median, 11 days) with a median  duration of 7 days. There was a notable difference in the inci- dence of arthritis (broader definition) between the age catego- ries 18–45 and 46–65 years. It was most pronounced in the 2 ×  107 group: 3.3% vs 7.5%, with a 95% CI for the difference (4.2%)  of 0.7%–7.8%. The difference in the 1 × 108 pfu group was less  pronounced (4.0% vs 4.6%). Combining all vaccine groups  resulted in an arthritis incidence rate of 3.5% (18–45 years) vs  6.8% (46–65 years) with a 95% CI for the difference (3.4%) of  0.4%–6.3%. Of 51 subjects with arthritis (broader definition), 8 (16%)  also reported rash. One subject also reported dermatitis, and  there were no cases of vasculitis. In some subjects with arthral- gia/arthritis, rash, and/or vesicular lesions, laboratory samples  were collected during the study if symptoms required further  investigations. Mild increases in C-reactive protein were noted in 22 sub- jects with these symptoms, and elevated alanine aminotransfer- ase levels were observed in 4 subjects. A total of 16 specimens were collected for the presence of  rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine virus by PCR testing: 8 skin  biopsies, 4 vesicular fluid, and 4 synovial fluid. Three specimens  were positive (1 synovial fluid, 1 skin biopsy, and 1 vesicular  fluid), 11 were negative, and 2 had an insufficient amount of  sample to test. Details are presented in the Supplementary  Materials. The proportion of subjects reporting SAEs was low across all  groups: 2.3% in the combined lots group, 1.2% in the high-dose  group, and 0% in the placebo group (Table2). There were no  discontinuations due to vaccine-relatedSAEs. Five pregnancies were reported during the first 42days post- vaccination. Two subjects were lost to follow-up, 2 subjects gave  birth with no AEs or complications reported, and 1 subject had  a spontaneous abortion. The estimated date of conception of the  latter subject was 5days postvaccination and the spontaneous  abortion occurred 4 weeks after conception. The subject did not  see a medical provider for the positive pregnancy test nor for  the spontaneous abortion. No further information is available.

Safety Data of Ebola Zaire Vaccine • JID 2017:XX (XX XXXX) • 5 Two subjects died during the study, both in the combined  lots group. Neither death was considered by the investigator  to be related to study vaccinations. A64-year-old woman died  of a craniocerebral injury after a fatal fall 152days postvacci- nation, and a 47-year-old man died of hepatic failure with an  onset 76days postvaccination. The latter subject was diagnosed  7years earlier with alcoholic pancreatitis and did not disclose  this condition to the study site that inadvertently enrolled this  subject in the study. DISCUSSION This phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial  was designed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of 3  consistency lots (2×107 pfu) and a high-dose lot (1×108 pfu)  of rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine in 1197 healthy adults.  The immunogenicity data are currently not available and  will be presented in a separate publication. The rVSVΔG-  ZEBOV-GP vaccine was generally well-tolerated. A higher  proportion of vaccine recipients than placebo recipients  reported local reactogenicity including pain, erythema, and  swelling as well as systemic reactogenicity including fever,  headache, arthralgia, pain, chills, and fatigue. These events  occurred principally during the first few days postvaccina- tion. The proportion of participants reporting injection-site  and systemic AEs were similar between all 4 vaccine groups.  Pain was the most common local reactogenicity finding,  occurring in up to 70% of subjects. Pyrexia was the most  common systemic reactogenicity finding, occurring in up to  29% of subjects. The majority of AEs were of mild to moder- ate intensity and resolved within 1 week; no SAEs were asso- ciated with rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccination. Arthralgia was  reported by 20% of subjects receiving high-dose and 17% of  subjects receiving low-dose vaccine. Arthralgia had a median  onset within 2days postvaccination, and lasted for a median  of 3days in the setting with other acute phase AEs such as  fever, headache, and myalgia. Arthritis (broader term) was  reported by 4.9% of all vaccinated subjects with a median  onset of 10–11days and duration of 5–7days. Arthritis was  reported more commonly in vaccinated subjects 46–65years  of age than subjects 18–45years ofage. Table1.

Of 11 subjects who reported arthralgia,  10 had undergone ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging.  Arthritis was diagnosed based on observed swelling on physical  examination or effusion on imaging. Subsequent evaluation of  arthritis in subjects vaccinated with 3×105 pfu (13 open-la- bel and 38 placebo-controlled) indicated that 13 (25%) subjects  reported arthralgia, 11 underwent imaging by ultrasound, and  12 (24%) had arthritis confirmed by clinical examination. Such  a high proportion of subjects with arthritis was not observed,  however, in the other phase 1 studies or at other WHO sites.  No cases of arthritis were reported in a double-blind study  conducted in the United States of 20 subjects vaccinated with  3×106 pfu and 20 subjects vaccinated with 2×107 pfu [5].  One case of arthritis each was reported in Hamburg, Germany,  where 20 subjects were vaccinated and Kilifi, Kenya, where  40 subjects were vaccinated (50% at each site vaccinated with  3×106 pfu and 50% with 2×107 pfu in an open-label fash- ion). There were no cases of arthritis observed in Lambaréné  (Gabon), where 39 subjects were vaccinated with either 3×106  pfu (n=20) or 3×107 pfu (n=19) [7]. The difference between the proportions of subjects report- ing arthritis in this study (4.9%) compared to the Geneva study  (22.5%) may be due to a more detailed clinical investigation  combined with imaging to identify arthritis at the Geneva site,  which was not performed in this study. The similar proportion  of subjects with arthralgia (17.9%) in this study as described in  the Geneva study (23.5%) supports this hypothesis. The median  onset and duration of arthritis in this study was similar to the  median onset (11 days) and duration (8 days) of arthritis at  the Geneva site. The presence of rVSV RNA in synovial fluid  in this and the Geneva study indicates seeding of rVSVΔG-  ZEBOV-GP vaccine virus into joints. This suggests that at least  some of the arthritis observed in this study could be classified as  vaccine-induced arthritis. All but 2 subjects with arthritis recov- ered during the 6months observation period. Those 2 subjects  had existing degenerative osteoarthritis and still experienced  some mild joint complaints at month 6.Rash was also reported  with some degree of variability across studies. At the Geneva  site, of the 11 subjects with arthritis who received either 1×107  pfu or 5×107 pfu of the vaccine, 3 (27%) reported a mild mac- ulopapular rash, whereas of the 13 subjects with arthritis who  received 3×105 pfu, 7 (54%) reported skin lesions that included  rash [6,7]. In our study, only 16% of the subjects with arthritis  reported rash. The Geneva site also reported an age-dependent  Table6.

Safety Data of Ebola Zaire Vaccine • JID 2017:XX (XX XXXX) • 9 effect on the incidence of arthritis. However, this was only  observed in the low-dose groups (3×105 pfu) but not in the  more comparable high-dose groups (1×107 or 5×107 pfu).  In this larger study, the increased incidence of arthritis in the  older age group (46–65) was observed in both the 2×107 pfu  and 1×108 pfu groups. Limitations to the interpretation of this study may include  the fact that enrollment was restricted to subjects in North  America and Europe, rather than Africa, where Ebola outbreaks  have occurred and where the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine is  most likely to be utilized in future outbreaks. However, there  are a number of ongoing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP studies in Africa  that will shed more light on the safety and immunogenicity in  the target population such as (1) a randomized, double-blind,  placebo-controlled trial (Partnership for Research on EBOV  Vaccines in Liberia [PREVAIL]); (2) a randomized open-label  trial to evaluate EBOV vaccine efficacy and safety in Guinea  (“Ebola ça suffit”); and (3) a randomized open-label trial (Sierra  Leone Trial to Introduce a Vaccine Against EBOV [STRIVE])  [9–12]. This is the first phase 3 study reporting a detailed safety pro- file of the clinical 2×107 pfu rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP dose. This  is the dose used in the Guinea ring study in which a 100% (95%  CI, 74.7%–100.0%) efficacy of the vaccine in preventing Ebola  virus disease was observed [10]. In general, the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine was well-   tolerated, with increased rates of injection-site and systemic  AEs compared to placebo observed in the lot consistency  groups vaccinated with the clinical 2×107 pfu dose, as well as  the group vaccinated with a higher dose of 1×108 pfu. There  were no vaccine-related SAEs observed. The study supports the  use of the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine in persons at risk for  Ebola virus disease.

William Shuttleworth, PhD3 Departments of 1Neurosurgery, 2Internal Medicine, and 3Neurosciences, University of New Mexico School of Medicine,  Albuquerque, New Mexico OBJECTIVE Retrospective clinical data and case studies support a therapeutic effect of ketamine in suppression of  spreading depolarization (SD) following brain injury. Preclinical data strongly support efficacy in terms of frequency of SD  as well as recovery from electrocorticography (ECoG) depression. The authors present the results of the first prospec- tive controlled clinical trial testing the role of ketamine used for clinical sedation on occurrence of SD. METHODS Ten patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) or aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) were  recruited for this pilot trial. A standard ECoG strip was placed at the time of craniotomy, and the patients were then  placed on an alternating every-6-hour schedule of ketamine or other sedation agent. The order of treatment was ran- domized. The ketamine dose was adjusted to clinical effect or maintained at a subanesthetic basal dose (0.1 mg/kg/hr)  if no sedation was required. SD was scored using standard criteria, blinded to ketamine dosing. Occurrence of SD was  compared with the hourly dose of ketamine to determine the effect of ketamine on SD occurrence. RESULTS Successful ECoG recordings were obtained in all 10 patients: 8 with SAH and 2 with TBI. There were a  total of 1642 hours of observations with adequate ECoG: 833 hours off ketamine and 809 hours on ketamine. Analysis  revealed a strong dose-dependent effect such that hours off ketamine or on doses of less than 1.15 mg/kg/hr were  associated with an increased risk of SD compared with hours on doses of 1.15 mg/kg/hr or more (OR 13.838, 95% CI  1.99–1000). This odds ratio decreased with lower doses of 1.0 mg/kg/hr (OR 4.924, 95% CI 1.337–43.516), 0.85 mg/kg/ hr (OR 3.323, 95% CI 1.139–16.074), and 0.70 mg/kg/hr (OR 2.725, 95% CI 1.068–9.898) to a threshold of no effect at  0.55 mg/kg/hr (OR 1.043, 95% CI 0.565–2.135). When all ketamine data were pooled (i.e., on ketamine at any dose vs  off ketamine), a nonsignificant overall trend toward less SD during hours on ketamine (c2 = 3.86, p = 0.42) was observed. CONCLUSIONS Ketamine effectively inhibits SD over a wide range of doses commonly used for sedation, even in non- intubated patients. These data also provide the first prospective evidence that the occurrence of SD can be influenced  by clinical intervention and does not simply represent an unavoidable epiphenomenon after injury. These data provide  the basis for future studies assessing clinical improvement with SD-directed therapy.

While  normally perfused brain can recover from SD without  injury, brain with marginal perfusion may not be able to  recover from repeat SD, leading to infarct expansion. Im- paired neurovascular coupling in the wake of SD likely  exacerbates deleterious consequences of an injured brain.9  Consistent with predictions from preclinical models, clus- ters of SDs are linked to infarct progression in brain injury  in humans.12,27 SD has been found to occur in most (60%–80%) pa- tients in the days following severe traumatic brain injury  (TBI) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)12,17 and has  been correlated with worse clinical outcomes.17 Clinical  efforts to limit SD are still in the early stages of explora- tion. There are many unanswered questions regarding the  optimal agent to target SD and how to ensure that thera- peutics are delivered to the at-risk tissue despite poten- tially lower blood flow to injured brain. Initial case report  data have suggested that in patients with very frequent SD,  ketamine exerted a profound and complete suppressive  effect on SD.31,33 This led to the retrospective review of  electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings in 115 patients  across participating centers, which demonstrated that ket- amine, unlike other agents, had a consistent, dose-depen- dent, suppressive effect on the incidence of SD.23 Based  on these data, we designed a pilot trial to prospectively  test the efficacy of ketamine sedation in the neuro-ICU  in terms of SD suppression (clinical trial registration no.  NCT02501941 [clinicaltrials.gov]). Methods Neuromonitoring and ECoG We prospectively included 10 patients with aneurysmal  SAH or severe TBI with injury severity requiring inva- sive monitoring and craniotomy (for aneurysm clipping in  SAH or hemicraniectomy in TBI). Consent was obtained  via a legally authorized representative prior to surgery, and  the study was approved by the University of New Mexico  Human Research Protections Office. Monitoring of ECoG  for SD was conducted using established techniques.10,18  Briefly, at the time of surgery, a 1 × 6 platinum cortical  electrode (Integra Epilepsy) was placed on either the fron- tal or temporal lobe and tunneled subcutaneously through  a posterior burr hole. The location of the strip was intended  to be in potentially at-risk territory without being in com- pleted infarction. At-risk territory was defined in SAH as  the lobe most likely to experience vasospasm (e.g., tempo- ral lobe for the middle cerebral artery, medial frontal lobe  for the anterior communicating artery). In TBI, the strip  was placed adjacent to any visibly contused brain. Moni- toring was conducted using a full-spectrum direct current  (DC) amplifier and collected using a Moberg Component  Neuromonitoring system (CNS; Moberg Research Inc.).  Real-time data were reviewed using the Moberg Reader  desktop program for ongoing data integrity. The strip was  removed at the bedside when clinical invasive monitoring  was discontinued (typically 7–14 days). After collection,  data were exported to LabChart (version 8.0, ADInstru- ments) where raw DC data for each channel as well as  high-frequency filtered (0.5–50 Hz) data were displayed,  together with the 60-second integral of the power of the  filtered data, per standard analysis recommendations.10 Ketamine Dosing After the patient returned from the operating room, a  washout period was maintained to avoid immediate post- operative anesthesia effects. This period ranged from 1  to 5 hours to begin medication dosing on a standardized  schedule (see below). The patients were then randomized  to start on either ketamine sedation or the other seda- tion regimen. The other sedation agent was determined  per the intensivist. This agent was typically propofol or  dexmedetomidine in intubated patients and midazolam or  dexmedetomidine in nonintubated patients. Sedation was  then titrated to a Riker Sedation-Agitation Scale score of 4  (calm, easily arousable, follows commands).29 A standard- ized hospital-wide ketamine titration protocol was adopt- ed and approved for use to ensure consistency of sedation.  The randomized start order was then initiated at the next  hour divisible by 6 (06:00, 12:00, 18:00, or 24:00). Medi- cations were then alternated every 6 hours. If no sedation  was required, a basal rate of 0.1 mg/kg/hr of ketamine was  then continued during the ketamine-assigned hours, and  no medications were given during the “other” hours. This  regimen was continued until the monitoring electrode was  removed. After electrode removal, there were no further  study-related interventions, and routine clinical care con- tinued. Analysis SD was identified using standard, previously validated  techniques.18 Briefly, this involved identification of a char- acteristic of DC deflection typically accompanied by sup- pression of high-frequency ECoG data occurring on adja- cent electrodes with temporal separation of < 10 minutes.  Other nuances to scoring have been previously discussed,10  and cases of uncertainty were resolved by consensus be- tween the senior authors (A.P.C. and C.W.S.) or not scored  as SD. SD was scored independently and blinded to the  medication regimen described below. Periods of poor data  or lead disconnection were marked for exclusion in analy- sis. The duration of depression and of DC deflection were  then scored for each SD. The number of SD occurrences  per hour was then noted for each hour of recording. Af- ter blinded scoring, the total hourly dose of ketamine for  each hour of ECoG recording was then extracted. Due to  the multiple crossover design, patients acted as their own  control, for both injury type and time after injury, and time  of day. For this reason, overall hours were compared in- dependently of patients. We primarily chose this pooled  method for this pilot analysis because effects on SD, such  as injury type, severity, presence of vasospasm or stroke,  systemic hypotension, and other factors, could severely  skew a per-patient analysis, even if internally controlled.  The chi-square test1 was used to determine the statistical  significance of odds for the occurrence of SD on versus off  ketamine. Due to the known dose-dependent effects of ketamine,32  a preplanned dose-response analysis was also then per- J Neurosurg May 25, 2018 3 A. P. Carlson et al. formed to determine a threshold of dosing for ketamine  suppression. The Cochran-Armitage3,6 trend test was used  to test the trend in SD proportions in ketamine dose groups.  Logistic regression modeling1 was used to estimate the  dose effect associated with sequential dose reductions in  ketamine. Appropriate intervals were determined by man- ual calculations of various dosing intervals and validation  of a significant trend using the aforementioned technique.  In addition, the duration of depression was also compared  between hours on and off of ketamine to determine if there  was an effect of shortening this depression. Duration of de- pression was defined as the longest recoverable depression  after each SD. The initiation of the loss of the integral of  the power was used as the start of depression and the be- ginning of recovery as the end of depression, as previously  reported.10 Finally, to address the historical concern of pos- sible increased intracranial pressure (ICP) with ketamine,7  the correlation of ketamine dose with hourly recorded ICP  was studied using mixed-effects modeling with patients as  a random variable. Individual patient regression analyses  were also performed to determine if there was a signifi- cant effect in some patients. Analysis was performed using  SAS (version 9.4, SAS Institute Inc.). Results Recordings Successful ECoG recordings were obtained in all 10  patients. Table 1 shows demographic characteristics of  the patients. Figure 1 shows an example SD and electrode  strip position. Eight patients had aneurysmal SAH requir- ing clipping, and 2 had severe TBI with elevated ICP that  was unresponsive to medical management and required  hemicraniectomy. No patient had a serious adverse event  related to the monitoring or medication alternation. One  patient experienced agitation during ketamine dosing after  3 days, and so the medication alternation was discontinued  and the electrode strip removed. In this patient, there was  persistent severe agitation requiring multiple sedation regi- mens; the agitation was not thought to be directly related  to ketamine administration. There were no instances of  wound leakage, hematoma, or other complications noted  around the electrode. Moderate-Dose Ketamine Inhibits SD There were a total of 1642 hours of observations with  adequate ECoG: 833 hours off ketamine and 809 hours on  ketamine. The analysis revealed a strong dose-dependent  effect such that hours off ketamine or on doses of less than  1.15 mg/kg/hr were associated with an increased risk of  SD compared with hours on doses of 1.15 mg/kg/hr or  TABLE 1.

While both displayed a significant dose-dependent reduc- tion in effect with sequential dose decreases, the interval  of 1.15 mg/kg/hr resulted in a consistent and highly signifi- cant trend using the Cochran-Armitage test and was cho- sen for further analysis (Z = -3.021, dim = 5, p = 0.00126).  The odds of occurrence of SD progressively decreased as  each 0.15-mg/kg/hr interval was tested at doses of 1.0 mg/ kg/hr (OR 4.924, 95% CI 1.337–43.516), 0.85 mg/kg/hr  (OR 3.323, 95% CI 1.139–16.074), and 0.70 mg/kg/hr (OR  2.725, 95% CI 1.068–9.898) to a threshold of no effect at  0.55 mg/kg/hr (OR 1.043, 95% CI 0.565–2.135). In linear  regression, a decrease of 0.15 mg/kg/hr in dose was found  to be associated with a twofold increase in the odds of SD  (OR 1.973, 95% CI 1.265–3.503). We repeated this dose ef- fect analysis per patient and found that while the individual  dose effects were not significant, there was a trend toward  reduction of SD with an increased dose of ketamine in 7  of 9 patients with SD. This supports the use of the pooled  analysis as a reasonable summary of the overall effect of  ketamine on SD across patients. When all ketamine data  were pooled (i.e., on ketamine at any dose vs off ketamine),  a nonsignificant overall trend toward less SD during hours  on ketamine (c2 = 3.86, p = 0.42) was observed. Effect of Ketamine on ECoG Suppression and DC  Deflection There was nonsignificant effect of ketamine on the  mean duration of depression after SD (F = 2.62, p = 0.11).  We also tested the effect of higher-dose ketamine (below  the threshold for complete suppression of SD), but did not  detect a significant effect on duration of these events either.  The number of events was relatively small, and our study  was not powered to detect such an effect, which, to date,  has not been described in humans despite significant data  in animals. Effect of Ketamine on ICP In our mixed-effects model of the effect of ketamine  on ICP, we found no significant overall effect (p = 0.6052).  In individual patient regression analysis, only 2 patients  were found to have a positive association of ketamine with  ICP (not significant), while most were neutral; 3 patients  seemed to show a protective effect of higher doses of ket- amine on ICP, one of which was significant (Fig. 3). Discussion This study provides the first prospective evidence sup- porting the efficacy of ketamine in decreasing the SD  incidence in ICU patients with acute neurological injury.  Significant benefit was seen at doses greater than 1.15 mg/ kg/hr with a very large effect size of over 13 times the  odds of SD at lower doses. The effect of all doses of ket- amine on SD incidence was not significant, likely due to  the influence on the group analysis from the patients on  very low doses (0.1 mg/kg/hr) when no clinical sedation  was required. The pragmatic experimental approach used  here was necessary in a pilot trial, where the use of the  medications was titrated for sedation purposes only.

Plot of frequency of SD occurrences per hour (circles) versus dose of ketamine. All SD occurrences were at doses below  1.15 mg/kg/hr. A further trend toward less frequent occurrence (SD/hr) can also be clearly noted, though the numbers with > 2 SD/ hr are small. J Neurosurg May 25, 2018 5 A. P. Carlson et al. mg/kg/hr, adds to the strength of the conclusion of clini- cal efficacy on SD. These pilot data also provide proof-of- concept confirmation that clinical trials targeting SD are  technically feasible. Given the strong association of SD  with clinical outcome,10,12,19,20 we believe that such trials  targeting SD and the well-documented associated deleteri- ous effects would be highly likely to result in improved  clinical outcomes. The concern that SD may be either an epiphenomenon  of brain injury or merely a non-causative marker of injury  severity is clearly an important issue for the development  of interventions. However, multiple lines of preclinical  and clinical evidence over the past several years support  a causative role of SD in injury progression after brain in- jury. One line of evidence is based on animal and brain  slice models, where SD clearly leads to progressive tis- sue injury in vulnerable tissues.2,5,19,37 Clinical data also  strongly support the independent deleterious effect of SD  beyond being a marker for severity of injury. Hartings et  al.17 examined 109 patients with severe TBI across multiple  centers and concluded that occurrence of SD—particu- larly that occurring in already dysfunctional brain—cor- responded to a greater than 7 times odds of poor outcome.  Dreier et al.12 demonstrated the temporally relevant nature  of these events in SAH patients, where clusters of SD were  reliably observed preceding every documented episode of  delayed ischemic neurological deficit. This observation ar- gues strongly that the clusters play a causative role in such  clinical deterioration. In a study correlating brain micro- dialysis with occurrence of SD, Feuerstein et al. noted se- quential and stepwise reduction in glucose with each SD.15  Remarkably, they also noted that if there was a period of  no SD, glucose would increase and again be depleted with  sequential SD when the events recurred. Dreier et al.11  and Hinzman et al.24 have similarly convincingly demon- strated repeated waves of cortical ischemia accompanying  SD, particularly in injured brain, leading to expansion of  infarcts. There are, unquestionably, multiple issues that remain  to be addressed regarding how best to target SD as a po- tential mechanism to improve outcomes after acute neu- rological injury. These issues include the optimal patients,  agent, delivery, and timing. We chose to begin the current  pilot trial in this manner because SAH and TBI patients  are known to have a high frequency of SD but do not all go  on to experience expansion of infarction. We chose to study ketamine because there are clear  preclinical data regarding the effect of ketamine on both  occurrence and severity of SD,16,22 because there are pre- liminary reports of efficacy for SD,23,30,31 and because it is  widely clinically available and used for sedation in critical  care. Ketamine, a noncompetitive N-methyl-d-aspartate  receptor antagonist, is thought to block SD by binding  and stabilizing the glutamate binding site, which in turn  stabilizes the membrane from the mass depolarization of  SD.16,26,32 In the retrospective study of ICU medications by  Hertle et al.,23 it is likely the “S” enantiomer of ketamine,  which is available in Europe, was used in many centers,  as opposed to the racemic ketamine, which is available in  the US. This may be relevant because of differences in po- tency and pharmacokinetics between these two types of  ketamine.14,36 Another design consideration is whether the  periods that patients were on sedation regimens other than  ketamine is truly a control group. In the retrospective data  from Hertle et al.,23 neither propofol nor midazolam had a  significant effect on overall SD occurrence; however, mid- azolam slightly increased the odds of clusters of SD, and  propofol slightly decreased these odds.23 Certainly, there  may be clinically relevant effects of other such medica- tions that could potentially influence any comparative  study. Since the predominant other medication was propo- fol, which had a nonsignificant trend toward decreased SD  in the retrospective review,23 it is possible that any poten- tial therapeutic effect in our study could have led to an un- derestimation of the therapeutic effect of ketamine. Other  interactions, such as with dexmedetomidine, are also pos- sible; however, given the relatively short therapeutic half- lives of all the sedation medications used, such contamina- tion is unlikely to have had a minimal overall effect on the  results. In addition, our data seem to add further support to the  argument that ketamine does not cause increased ICP,7  even in patients with severe brain injury. We found no  overall effect of ketamine dose on ICP and on individual  patient analysis; in fact, we found more patients with trends  toward decreased ICP with higher doses of ketamine than  those with a positive association. Regarding timing of treatment, it is also unclear wheth- er detection of SD is necessary to treat TBI and SAH pa- tients, or whether SD-directed therapy should be univer- sally given to SD-prone patients. On one hand, treating all  patients may expose some patients who are lower risk to  the side effects of the therapy; on the other hand, there are  limitations in immediate bedside detection of SD, so that  even in patients with continuous ECoG strip recording,  FIG. 3. Individual linear regression analysis of each of the 9 patients  with ICP monitoring regarding the effect of ketamine on ICP. The overall  mixed-effects model showed no significant association. Note that in  individual patients, the trends are quite variable, with some patients  showing a negative association. A. P. Carlson et al. J Neurosurg May 25, 2018 6 there is a potential risk that SD could be occurring in a  region distant from the strip. Our study has limitations that prevent immediate adop- tion into clinical practice. We did not perform analysis  per patient due to the multiple crossover design, and so no  outcome data could be evaluated. This multiple crossover  design allowed us to perform a pilot proof-of-concept trial  as a stepping stone to larger trials. We did not perform  a pharmacokinetic analysis, and so it is possible that the  administered dose could have a variable relationship to  the true plasma concentration depending on factors such  as length of administration and other medication interac- tions. This will be an important topic in future trials. The  study group was somewhat heterogeneous, with 2 TBI pa- tients. Although pathophysiology can be very different in  these two groups, SD is documented in both, and thus we  considered it reasonable to group them for pilot testing.  There is some potential imbalance in groups also because  in the times when no sedation was required, our ketamine  group was given subtherapeutic ketamine while the stand- ard group received no medication. Since no therapeutic ef- fect was noted at doses lower than 0.55 mg/kg/hr, these  very low dose times probably did not significantly affect  our primary results. Finally, there are inherent sampling  limitations with currently used SD monitoring techniques.  The electrode strip only monitors a small region of the  brain, and though the strip is positioned in what is thought  to be the most susceptible region to ischemia, it is possible  that it is not representative of SD occurring in more dis- tant, vulnerable tissue. Based on animal data, it has been  hypothesized that the SD demonstrated on the electrode  is representative of events occurring remotely,10,32 but this  has not yet been confirmed. Based on previous studies, we expected a dose depen- dency to the treatment, but since a minimum effective  dose has not been clearly defined, we chose to perform  this pilot trial pragmatically, using only clinically required  sedation. This led to many hours of treatment at very low,  subanesthetic doses. It remains possible that there is a ben- eficial effect on the SD morphology at these lower doses;28  our relatively small numbers did not confirm this hypoth- esis. This is certainly a topic for future investigation since  in future trials, dosing must be well below the threshold  for respiratory depression in awake patients. A dose of 1  mg/kg is widely accepted as safe for procedural sedation,  with very rare reports of cardiorespiratory side effects,35  and thus it may be a reasonable starting point for such fu- ture study. Ketamine is widely and safely used, even in  an outpatient environment, but potential side effects and  toxicities, including sensorial side effects and respiratory  depression, can occur, particularly at higher doses;8 there- fore, selective use in high-risk patients might avert poten- tial concerns regarding such over-sedation and associated  pneumonia and deep venous thrombosis in the ICU. In future studies, there are many refinements that will  be required to prove efficacy of SD suppression as a means  to improving clinical outcome. First, selection of patients  is key and with current monitoring systems, it may now  be possible to detect SD at the bedside19 and only initi- ate treatment when SD has been documented. This will  overcome the concern of treating patients who would not  be expected to benefit from the treatment. Second, less in- vasive methods of monitoring SD are actively and rapidly  being explored. Traditional scalp EEG may offer some  hint at the cortical process13,21 but likely is not adequate- ly spatially resolved to detect SD. Noninvasive methods  are therefore a significant focus of future study to allow  enrollment and treatment of patients not requiring crani- otomy or burr hole. Conclusions Ketamine effectively inhibits SD over a wide range of  doses commonly used for sedation, even in nonintubated  patients. These data also provide the first prospective  evidence that the occurrence of SD can be influenced by  clinical intervention and does not simply represent an un- avoidable epiphenomenon after injury. These data provide  the basis for future studies assessing clinical improvement  with SD-directed therapy.

BACKGROUND Daprodustat is an oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor. In  patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are not undergoing dialysis, the  efficacy and safety of daprodustat, as compared with the conventional erythropoi- esis-stimulating agent darbepoetin alfa, are unknown. METHODS In this randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial with blinded adjudication of cardio- vascular outcomes, we compared daprodustat with darbepoetin alfa for the treat- ment of anemia in patients with CKD who were not undergoing dialysis. The  primary outcomes were the mean change in the hemoglobin level from baseline  to weeks 28 through 52 and the first occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular  event (MACE; a composite of death from any cause, nonfatal myocardial infarc- tion, or nonfatal stroke). RESULTS Overall, 3872 patients were randomly assigned to receive daprodustat or darbepo- etin alfa. The mean (±SD) baseline hemoglobin levels were similar in the two  groups. The mean (±SE) change in the hemoglobin level from baseline to weeks  28 through 52 was 0.74±0.02 g per deciliter in the daprodustat group and 0.66±0.02  g per deciliter in the darbepoetin alfa group (difference, 0.08 g per deciliter; 95%  confidence interval [CI], 0.03 to 0.13), which met the prespecified noninferiority  margin of −0.75 g per deciliter. During a median follow-up of 1.9 years, a first  MACE occurred in 378 of 1937 patients (19.5%) in the daprodustat group and in  371 of 1935 patients (19.2%) in the darbepoetin alfa group (hazard ratio, 1.03; 95%  CI, 0.89 to 1.19), which met the prespecified noninferiority margin of 1.25. The  percentages of patients with adverse events were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Among patients with CKD and anemia who were not undergoing dialysis,   daprodustat was noninferior to darbepoetin alfa with respect to the change in  the hemoglobin level from baseline and with respect to cardiovascular out- comes.

These agents stimulate endogenous eryth- ropoietin production by stabilizing the HIF-α  subunit, allowing it to dimerize with the HIF-β  subunit and to stimulate genes involved in pro- tection against hypoxia, including the erythropoi- etin gene.9,10 HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors  also influence iron homeostasis through effects  on transferrin, transferrin receptor expression,  hepcidin, and other iron-related proteins.9,10 Phase 2 trials involving patients with CKD  who were receiving dialysis11 and those who were  not receiving dialysis12 showed that daprodustat,  an orally active HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor,  had a good safety profile and had efficacy over  24 weeks. In the current trial, ASCEND-ND (Ane- mia Studies in Chronic Kidney Disease: Erythro- poiesis via a Novel Prolyl Hydroxylase Inhibitor  Daprodustat–Non-Dialysis), we evaluated the ef- ficacy and safety of the HIF prolyl hydroxylase  inhibitor daprodustat, as compared with the con- ventional ESA darbepoetin alfa, in patients with  CKD who were not undergoing dialysis. Methods Trial Design and Oversight The sponsor, GlaxoSmithKline, and an academic  steering committee designed and oversaw the trial  conduct and analysis. The members of the aca- demic steering committee are listed in Table S1  in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the  full text of this article at NEJM.org. The trial was  conducted and reported in accordance with the  protocol (which includes the statistical analysis  plan), available at NEJM.org. The trial was ap- proved by the ethics committee at each center.  An independent data monitoring committee over- saw the safety of the patients. Analyses that were  conducted by the sponsor were independently  replicated by an academic group at the Robert- son Centre for Biostatistics at the University of  Glasgow. The first draft of the manuscript was pre- pared by the first author, who had unrestricted  access to the data, and was reviewed and edited  by all the authors. All the authors made the deci- sion to submit the manuscript for publication and  vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the  data and for the fidelity of the trial to the proto- col. Earlier versions of the manuscript and fig- ures were drafted with editorial assistance fund- ed by the sponsor. Patients Adults were eligible for screening if they had  stage 3 to 5 CKD and were not currently receiv- ing dialysis or scheduled to start dialysis within  90 days, met the hemoglobin and ESA criteria, and  had a serum ferritin level of more than 100 ng per  milliliter and a transferrin saturation above 20%.  Patients who had anemia that was unrelated to  CKD, a recent cardiovascular event, or current or  recent cancer were excluded. A complete list of  inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in  Table S2. Trial Procedures The trial consisted of four periods: screening,  placebo run-in, treatment, and follow-up (Fig. S1).  The patients were evaluated at least every 4 weeks  during the first year of the trial and at least every  12 weeks thereafter. Patients who provided written informed con- sent and who met all inclusion and exclusion  criteria received placebo tablets during a 4-week  run-in period, and those who had received ESA  therapy previously continued to receive an ESA dur- ing the screening and run-in periods. Patients were  eligible to undergo randomization if they met  the criteria for adherence to the placebo run-in  period and had a hemoglobin level of 8.0 to 10.0 g  per deciliter (in patients who were not receiving  an ESA) or 8.0 to 11.0 g per deciliter (in patients  who were receiving an ESA). Eligible patients underwent randomization in  a 1:1 ratio (with the use of balanced blocks) to  receive either oral daprodustat or subcutaneous  darbepoetin alfa. The investigators used an inter- active voice-response or Web-response system to  determine the treatment assignments. Random- ization was stratified according to use or nonuse  A Quick Take is  available at   NEJM.org  The New England Journal of Medicine  Downloaded from nejm.org at Sichuan University on January 5, 2023.

Although the investi- gators and patients were aware of the treatment  assignments, the sponsor and steering committee  remained unaware of the aggregate treatment as- signments throughout the trial. Treatment Adjustment We used a trial-specific algorithm for both treat- ment groups to achieve and maintain the hemo- globin level in the target range of 10.0 to 11.0 g  per deciliter (Table S3). The starting dose of da- produstat was between 1 and 4 mg daily, accord- ing to the baseline hemoglobin level if the pa- tient was not receiving an ESA and according to  the ESA dose if the patient was receiving an ESA;  stepped changes ranging from 1 to 24 mg were  available for dose adjustments (Table S4). The starting dose of darbepoetin alfa was  based on the patient’s weight and hemoglobin  level at the time of randomization if the patient  was not receiving an ESA or on the previous ESA  dose if the patient was receiving an ESA. Stepped  changes in the dose were predefined, and most  steps increased the dose by 25 to 33%. A rescue  algorithm, which included a provision for the  use of intravenous iron, a red-cell transfusion, or  both (Table S5), and a protocol for iron manage- ment (Table S6) were also provided. Outcomes The trial had two primary noninferiority out- comes: the mean change in the hemoglobin  level from baseline to the primary evaluation  period (weeks 28 through 52) and the first oc- currence of an adjudicated major adverse cardio- vascular event (MACE; a composite of death from  any cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or non- fatal stroke). These and other cardiovascular events  were adjudicated by an independent committee  led by the Duke Clinical Research Institute in  collaboration with a contract research organiza- tion, George Clinical, whose members were un- aware of the treatment assignments. Details re- garding the adjudication charter are provided in  Section S1 in the Supplementary Appendix. The principal secondary outcomes, each tested  for superiority, were the time to the first occur- rence of a MACE (as described above but tested  for superiority rather than noninferiority), the first  occurrence of a MACE or a thromboembolic event,  the first occurrence of a MACE or hospitalization  for heart failure, and the first occurrence of CKD  progression. Statistical Analysis The trial was originally designed to enroll ap- proximately 4500 patients, with follow-up until  945 adjudicated first MACEs had occurred in  order to exclude a noninferiority margin of 1.20.  To accelerate trial closeout because of the coro- navirus disease 2019 pandemic, the noninferior- ity margin was changed to 1.25 in a protocol  amendment issued on July 30, 2020, before the  unblinding of the trial data.13 This noninferior- ity margin aligned with that used in other clini- cal trials of HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors,14  and although the target number of events was  reduced to 664, a power of approximately 90%  was maintained. The revised trial size provided  greater than 99% power for comparison of the  effect of daprodustat and darbepoetin alfa on the  change in the hemoglobin level from baseline,  with a noninferiority margin of −0.75 g per  deciliter. In the intention-to-treat population (all the  patients who had undergone randomization), the  two primary outcomes were tested in parallel for  noninferiority at a one-sided alpha level of 0.025.  The MACE composite outcome was analyzed with  the use of a Cox proportional-hazards model with  adjustment for treatment group, use or nonuse  of an ESA, and geographic region. Additional pre- specified supplementary MACE analyses were con- ducted and included an on-treatment analysis that  was restricted to events that had occurred be- tween the initiation of a trial drug and 28 days  after the last dose, the date of trial completion,  or withdrawal, whichever occurred first. For the primary hemoglobin outcome, the  mean change from baseline to the evaluation  period was assessed with the use of an analysis- of-covariance model after adjustment for the  baseline hemoglobin level and the variables used  in the MACE model. Missing hemoglobin values  were imputed with the use of multiple imputa- tion under the “missing at random” assumption. The principal secondary superiority analyses  would proceed only if noninferiority was estab- lished for both primary outcomes. We analyzed  the secondary cardiovascular outcomes using an  approach that was similar to that used for the  primary outcomes, and we evaluated the outcome  The New England Journal of Medicine  Downloaded from nejm.org at Sichuan University on January 5, 2023.

The Holm–Bonferroni method was used  to adjust for multiplicity. We conducted subgroup  analyses using statistical models that were simi- lar to those used in the primary and principal  secondary analyses, with the addition of the sub- group term and treatment-by-subgroup interac- tion terms. All analyses were performed with the  use of SAS software, version 9.4, or R software,  version 3.6.2 or later. Results Patients From December 5, 2016, through December 7,  2020, a total of 3872 patients were randomly as- signed to receive daprodustat or darbepoetin  alfa at 506 centers in 39 countries (Fig. S2). The  characteristics of the patients — including the  estimated glomerular filtration rate, coexisting  conditions, history of cardiovascular disease,  and previous ESA dose in patients who had re- ceived an ESA — were well balanced between  the trial groups at baseline (Table 1). The mean  (±SD) baseline hemoglobin level was 9.9±0.9 g  per deciliter across the two groups. Baseline char- acteristics according to the use or nonuse of an  ESA have been published previously.13 The trial  sample was representative of the population with  CKD not undergoing dialysis (Table S7). Specifi- cally, a post hoc analysis showed that 32.7% of  the trial patients in the United States were Black. Daprodustat was discontinued prematurely  for reasons other than death in 571 of 1937 pa- tients (29.5%), and darbepoetin alfa was discon- tinued prematurely for reasons other than death  in 560 of 1935 patients (28.9%) (Fig. S3). Nine- teen patients (<1.0%) in the daprodustat group  and 12 patients (<1.0%) in the darbepoetin alfa  group had unknown vital status at the end of the  trial. The median duration of follow-up for evalu- ation of cardiovascular events was 1.9 years (inter- quartile range, 1.0 to 2.7); this duration provided  7210 total person-years of follow-up. Primary Efficacy Outcomes and Median Doses The mean (±SE) change in the hemoglobin  level from baseline to weeks 28 through 52 was  0.74±0.02 g per deciliter in the daprodustat  group and 0.66±0.02 g per deciliter in the darbe- poetin alfa group (difference, 0.08 g per decili- ter; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03 to 0.13),  which met the prespecified noninferiority mar- gin (Table 2 and Fig. 1). Supplementary analyses  provided findings that were consistent with  those of the primary analysis (Fig. S4). The ef- fect of daprodustat as compared with darbepo- etin alfa was generally consistent across the pre- specified subgroups (Fig. S5). A rapid increase in the hemoglobin level, de- fined as an increase of more than 2 g per deci- liter during any 4-week period from randomiza- tion through the first year, was observed in 2% or  less of the patients in both trial groups. The  median doses are presented in Figure S6; 97% of  the patients who received daprodustat and 98%  of those who received darbepoetin alfa adhered  to the trial regimen. Primary Safety Outcome A first MACE occurred in 378 of 1937 patients  (19.5%) in the daprodustat group and in 371 of  1935 patients (19.2%) in the darbepoetin alfa  group (hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.19);  thus, the prespecified noninferiority margin of  1.25 was met (Table 2 and Fig. 2A). The results  were generally consistent across prespecified sub- groups (Fig. S7). These results were also broadly  consistent with those in other supplementary in- tention-to-treat analyses (Fig. S8). However, the  on-treatment MACE analysis, which censored  data on patients at 28 days after the date of the  last dose, showed a higher incidence of a first  MACE during the treatment period in the dapro- dustat group (14.1%) than in the darbepoetin  alfa group (10.5%) (hazard ratio, 1.40; 95% CI,  1.17 to 1.68). The analysis of values over the treatment pe- riod as defined did not take into account the  different dosing intervals in the daprodustat and  darbepoetin alfa groups, which resulted in dif- ferent observation periods. Post hoc analyses  were conducted to explore the effect of the dif- ferent dosing frequencies in this definition. These  post hoc analyses were more consistent with the  results of the primary analysis. Additional results  of time-to-event analyses, including the compo- nents of the MACE composite outcome, are shown  in Table S8.

The incidence of death from  any cause was similar in the two groups (hazard  ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.20). The decreases in the hepcidin level and trans- ferrin saturation and the increases in total iron- binding capacity from baseline were greater in the  daprodustat group than in the darbepoetin alfa  group (Table 1, Table 3, and Fig. S9). The decreases  in ferritin levels were similar and the total iron  levels were stable and similar in the two groups. A total of 39 of 1937 patients (2.0%) in the  daprodustat group and 64 of 1935 patients (3.3%)  in the darbepoetin alfa group met the criteria for  rescue therapy (i.e., a hemoglobin level <9.0 g per  deciliter or transfusion of more than 2 units of  packed red cells) and permanently discontinued  the assigned treatment (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI,  0.42 to 0.94) (Fig. S10). The percentages of patients  who received at least one red-cell or whole-blood  transfusion during the treatment period were  similar in the daprodustat group (12.8%) and the  darbepoetin alfa group (13.5%) (hazard ratio, 0.96;  95% CI, 0.81 to 1.14) (Fig. S11). Adverse Events Two patients (both in the darbepoetin alfa group)  were excluded from the safety analyses because  they did not receive the assigned treatment (Fig. 2).  Serious adverse events that started or worsened  after the initiation of trial treatment were re- ported in 850 of 1937 patients in the daprodustat  group (43.9%) and 703 of 1933 patients in the  darbepoetin alfa group (36.4%). Table 3 and Ta- ble S9 include the most common adverse events,  and Table S10 includes the most common seri- ous adverse events; there was no notable excess  of any event in the daprodustat group relative to  the darbepoetin alfa group. The incidences of the prespecified adverse  events of special interest during trial treatment  were generally consistent across the treatment  groups except for cancer and esophageal or gas- tric erosions, which occurred significantly more  often in the daprodustat group (Table 3). Post  hoc analyses of the differential dosing frequen- cies (Table S11) showed attenuation of the im- balance for cancer events, but not for erosions.  Daprodustat was similar to darbepoetin alfa with  respect to the effect on blood pressure and the  use of antihypertensive medications (Table S12). Discussion Daprodustat was as effective as darbepoetin alfa  in increasing and maintaining hemoglobin lev- els in patients with CKD and anemia who were  not receiving dialysis. The effect of daprodustat  on hemoglobin levels was consistent across  prespecified subgroups. Daprodustat was also  noninferior to darbepoetin alfa with respect to  cardiovascular safety in the primary analysis. In  addition, daprodustat and darbepoetin alfa had  a similar effect with respect to the definitions of  MACE expanded to include thromboembolic events  and hospitalization for heart failure. The results of our trial contrast with the  pooled results of the PRO2TECT trials.14 In those  trials, vadadustat, as compared with darbepoetin  alfa, did not meet the prespecified noninferiority  criterion for cardiovascular safety.14 The reason for  this difference is uncertain, since the PRO2TECT  trials and our trial had an identical primary  MACE composite outcome and showed similar  numbers of patients who had MACE outcome  events.14 Data are lacking from adequately powered  trials comparing roxadustat with a conventional  ESA in this population with respect to cardiovas- cular outcomes. In contrast to our primary analysis in the  intention-to-treat population, in which the inci- dences of MACE were similar in the two groups,  the analysis of on-treatment MACE results fa- vored darbepoetin alfa over daprodustat. Given  the markedly different half-lives of daprodustat  and darbepoetin alfa, different dosing frequen- cies were associated with different actual treat- ment periods for these two agents (daily for da- produstat and every 1 week, 2 weeks, or 4 weeks,  according to the dose, for darbepoetin alfa).

As has been  described elsewhere,15 concerns have been raised  regarding potential confounding associated with  the use of on-treatment analyses. The prespecified analysis involving the com- posite outcome indicated that daprodustat, as  compared with darbepoetin alfa, did not delay  progression of CKD, and there was no imbalance  between the treatment groups with respect to any  of the components of the composite outcome  that included both surrogate and hard outcomes.  These observations were consistent with the re- sults of the PRO2TECT trials.14 Together, these data  suggest that it is unlikely that HIF prolyl hydroxy- lase inhibitors slow CKD progression in a clini- cally significant manner. Two other findings are of clinical interest. In  our trial, we evaluated a rapid increase in the  hemoglobin level, as measured by an increase of  more than 2.0 g per deciliter over 4 weeks.

The observed chang- es in iron metabolism in patients assigned to  daprodustat may indicate more efficient iron  incorporation into red cells; these beneficial dif- ferences persisted over time and are consistent  with effects noted previously.12 Studies to further  explore the effect of daprodustat on iron kinetics  are lacking. Although the safety profile of daprodustat  was generally similar to that of darbepoetin  alfa, two adverse events of special interest were  more frequent among patients who received  daprodustat — cancer-related death and tumor  progression and recurrence, as well as esophageal  and gastric erosions. Post hoc analyses conducted  in the intention-to-treat population or that ac- counted for dosing frequency showed attenua- tion of the imbalance for cancer events, but not  for erosions. These observations warrant further  study. This trial has several limitations. First, the  open-label design and patient awareness of treat- ment assignment may have biased reporting of  adverse events. Second, since HIF activates tran- scription of many cytokines, which may have  oncogenic or other potential long-term adverse  effects, the observation time for this trial (al- though extended) may still be insufficient to  characterize the full risks. Third, we used darbe- poetin alfa as the ESA comparator, which might  limit conclusions about noninferiority to other  ESAs. Finally, the prespecified definitions for  MACE during the treatment period and treat- ment-related adverse events did not take into  account the different dosing frequencies. In this trial, we found that daprodustat was  noninferior to darbepoetin alfa, both in the  treatment of anemia in patients with CKD who  were not undergoing dialysis and with respect to  cardiovascular outcomes. This trial showed that  daprodustat and darbepoetin alfa had similar  efficacy. Figure 1. Hemoglobin Level, According to Visit (Intention-to-Treat Population). Shown are the mean hemoglobin levels over the trial duration among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who were not under- going dialysis and who were assigned to receive daprodustat or darbepoetin alfa. Visits on or before day 1 include only pretreatment   values. Visits after day 1 include all available values after randomization, regardless of whether the patient received trial treatment. The  hemoglobin target range for dose changes was 10.0 to 11.0 g per deciliter. The horizontal lines represent the hemoglobin analysis range  (10.0 to 11.5 g per deciliter), which is an extension of the hemoglobin target range to allow for variability.

0%%%%%%Effect of Canakinumab vs Placebo on Survival Without Invasive Mechanical Ventilation in Patients Hospitalized With Severe COVID-19 A Randomized Clinical Trial Roberto Caricchio, MD; Antonio Abbate, MD, PhD; Ivan Gordeev, PhD; Jamie Meng, MD, PhD; Priscilla Y Hsue, MD; Tuhina Neogi, MD, PhD; Roberto Arduino, MD; Daria Fomina, MD; Roman Bogdanov, MD; Tatiana Stepanenko, MD; Pilar Ruiz-Seco, MD; Andrés Gónzalez-García, MD, PhD; Yu Chen, MSc; Yuhan Li, MSc; Sarah Whelan, BSc, MSc; Stephanie Noviello, MD, MPH; for the CAN-COVID Investigators IMPORTANCE Effective treatments for patients with severe COVID-19 are needed. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy of canakinumab, an anti–interleukin-1β antibody, in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial was conducted at 39 hospitals in Europe and the United States. A total of 454 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, hypoxia (not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation [IMV]), and systemic hyperinflammation defined by increased blood concentrations of C-reactive protein or ferritin were enrolled between April 30 and August 17, 2020, with the last assessment of the primary end point on September 22, 2020. INTERVENTION Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive a single intravenous infusion of canakinumab (450 mg for body weight of 40-<60 kg, 600 mg for 60-80 kg, and 750 mg for >80 kg; n = 227) or placebo (n = 227). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was survival without IMV from day 3 to day 29. Secondary outcomes were COVID-19–related mortality, measurements of biomarkers of systemic hyperinflammation, and safety evaluations. RESULTS Among 454 patients who were randomized (median age, 59 years; 187 women [41.2%]), 417 (91.9%) completed day 29 of the trial. Between days 3 and 29, 198 of 223 patients (88.8%) survived without requiring IMV in the canakinumab group and 191 of 223 (85.7%) in the placebo group, with a rate difference of 3.1% (95% CI, −3.1% to 9.3%) and an odds ratio of 1.39 (95% CI, 0.76 to 2.54; P = .29). COVID-19–related mortality occurred in 11 of 223 patients (4.9%) in the canakinumab group vs 16 of 222 (7.2%) in the placebo group, with a rate difference of −2.3% (95% CI, −6.7% to 2.2%) and an odds ratio of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.30 to 1.50). Serious adverse events were observed in 36 of 225 patients (16%) treated with canakinumab vs 46 of 223 (20.6%) who received placebo. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19, treatment with canakinumab, compared with placebo, did not significantly increase the likelihood of survival without IMV at day 29.

Methods Trial Design and Oversight This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial was conducted at 39 hospitals in Europe and the United States with varying standard care treatment approaches both regionally and over the course of the pandemic. The ethics committee of each site provided approval. Participat- ing patients provided written informed consent. An inde- pendent safety monitoring committee provided oversight. The study protocol and statistical analysis plan are available in Supplement 1 and Supplement 2, respectively. In the double-blind phase 3 CAN-COVID trial, patients hos- pitalized with severe COVID-19 were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 1 dose of canakinumab or placebo. In addi- tion, all patients continued to receive standard care treat- ment for COVID-19 per local practice. Efficacy and monitoring of adverse events (AEs) were per- formed daily, and laboratory assessments every other day un- til day 29 and on days 57 and 127, in hospitalized patients. For patients who had been discharged from the hospital, follow-up visits conducted by telephone were scheduled at days 15, 29, 57, and 127. Herein we report results of the interim analyses per- formed after all patients completed day 29, when the pri- mary and secondary end points were analyzed. Patients Eligible participants were hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, at least 12 years old (United States) or 18 years old (Europe), and had hypoxemia but did not require IMV. Inclu- sion criteria included a diagnosis of infection with SARS- CoV-2 within 7 days prior to randomization, diagnosis of pneu- monia with pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray or computed tomographic scan within 5 days prior to randomization, pe- ripheral capillary oxygen saturation of 93% or less on room air or arterial oxygen partial pressure/fraction of inspired oxy- gen less than 300 mm Hg, and blood levels of CRP of 20 mg/L or greater or ferritin of 600 μg/L or greater. Patients were not eligible if they had been treated with therapies targeting IL-1 or IL-6, had a suspected or known untreated active infection due to another pathogen, or if progression to death was im- minent within 24 hours according to the investigator. Randomization The randomization was stratified by country, with a block size of 4 within each stratum. It was implemented using an inter- active response technology system in which a new patient meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria was randomly as- signed to a treatment group based on a random allocation se- quence. This sequence was created by a separate randomiza- tion office of the sponsor and kept blinded to the study team until the scheduled unblinding for data analysis. Interventions Randomized patients received a single dose of canakinumab (450 mg for body weight of 40-<60 kg, 600 mg for 60-80 kg, and 750 mg for >80 kg) or placebo in 250 mL of 5% dextrose infusedintravenouslyover2hours.Thestudytherapywaspre- pared by an unblinded pharmacist independent of the study team to maintain the blind. After dilution, canakinumab and placebo preparations were indistinguishable. Use of glucocorticoids, convalescent serum or plasma, antivirals, and anticoagulants was permitted during the trial. Per protocol, immunomodulatory therapies, such as biologic agents targeting IL-1 or IL-6, or tumor necrosis fac- tor were prohibited. Key Points Question Is the anti–interleukin-1β antibody canakinumab effective to treat patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and hyperinflammation? Finding This randomized clinical trial included 454 patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and with elevated C-reactive protein or ferritin levels. Treatment with intravenous canakinumab vs placebo resulted in survival without IMV at 29 days of 88.8% vs 85.7%, a difference that was not statistically significant. Meaning Among patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19, treatment with canakinumab, compared with placebo, did not significantly increase the likelihood of survival without IMV.

A patient was defined as a nonre- sponder if the worst clinical status at any time from day 3 (in- clusive) up to day 29 (inclusive) was category 6, 7, or 8 on the WHO 9-point ordinary scale, corresponding to requiring IMV or death. Day 3 was used as the initial day of assessment due to the potential rapid deterioration of patients’ clinical status with natural SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients who discontin- ued the study or were lost to follow-up before day 29 were con- sidered responders if they did not require IMV at any time af- ter day 3 and fulfilled 1 of 2 conditions: discharged from the hospital with a clinical status of 0 or 1 on the WHO 9-point or- dinal scale or the last assessment of clinical status occurred at day 15 or later and was better than at baseline. The key secondary outcome was the proportion of pa- tients who died of COVID-19 (causality assessed by investiga- tors) between days 1 and 29. Other secondary outcomes were the ratio to baseline in serologic biomarkers reflecting sys- temic hyperinflammation (CRP, ferritin, and D-dimer levels) and safety evaluations based on the analysis of AEs until day 29. Supplemental and sensitivity analyses on the primary and secondary efficacy end points are described in eAppendix 1 in Supplement 3. Three predefined exploratory analyses on the primary end point included the number of patients who met the nonresponder criteria for the primary end point or used any prohibited anti–IL-1 or anti–IL-6 medications during the study from day 1 up to day 29, the primary end point re- sponse by subgroups (see complete list of subgroups in eAp- pendix 2 of Supplement 3), and time to use of IMV or death up to day 29. Other predefined exploratory outcomes included time to death, change in clinical status from day 1 to day 29 using the WHO 9-point ordinal scale and during hospitalization, time to treatment response such as discharge from hospital, dura- tion for in-hospital outcomes such as in the intensive care unit, duration receiving therapy with supplementary oxygen, du- ration receiving IMV, and change in the American Associa- tion for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy grade for cyto- kine release syndrome over time, which was calculated based on hypotension and hypoxia.15 Pharmacokinetic, pharmaco- dynamic, and biomarker analyses will be evaluated after study completion and are not reported in this article. Sample Size Based on the literature available at the time of study design, the IMV-free survival rate in the target hospitalized popula- tion was assumed to be in the range from 20% to 50%. With a 1:1 randomization ratio and 2-sided type I error con- trol at .05, a sample size of 450 patients was calculated to pro- vide at least 89% power for the primary analysis to detect a difference of at least 15% in the rate of survival without re- quiringIMV.Thisdifferencewasdefinedastheminimumclini- cally meaningful benefit of interest. Statistical Analysis Efficacy analyses were performed using the full analysis set comprising all randomized patients according to the treat- ment assigned by randomization. Safety analyses were per- formed using the safety data set including data from all par- ticipants who received study treatment. Analysis of the primary efficacy end point included ran- domized patients who received study treatment and who had at least 1 assessment of clinical status between days 3 and 29. Patients who died or discontinued from the study before day 3 were excluded from the primary analysis but were included in a supplementary analysis on the primary end point. The proportions of patients in the canakinumab and placebo groups who survived by day 29 without using IMV anytime from day 3 to day 29 were compared based on their odds ratio (OR)—which was estimated using a logistic regression model on the logit of probability for survival without the need for IMV with study treatment as main effect—and adjusted by region (United States, Europe) and baseline clini- cal status (≤4, ≥5) on the WHO 9-point ordinal scale. A patient who discontinued early from the study or was lost to Figure 1.

Otherwise, the patient was con- sidered as a nonresponder. A supplementary analysis was performed in which all patients who were lost to follow-up or discontinued the study before day 29 with a clinical status higher than 1 were considered as nonresponders. As a sensi- tivity analysis, the difference in the rates of IMV-free survival between treatment groups was estimated using a marginal standardization method in which the rate difference was derived from the predicted rates for every patient using a logistic regression model, with treatment as main effect of interest adjusted by region and baseline clinical status.16 The same logistic regression model for the primary analy- sis was used for the key secondary end point of death related to COVID-19 during the 29-day period after study treatment and for the exploratory end point of IMV-free survival with- out use of anakinra or tocilizumab. The hypothesis tests for primary and key secondary analy- ses were conducted in hierarchical order with the 2-sided family-wise type I error rate controlled at 0.05, which was also the threshold for statistical significance. No other secondary, exploratory, or supplementary analyses presented were in- cluded as part of the testing hierarchy that controlled for mul- tiplicity. Because of the potential for type I error due to mul- tiple comparisons, findings for analyses of secondary end points should be interpreted as exploratory. Time to death or use of IMV, time to death, and use of IMV or of anakinra or tocilizumab were evaluated using survival analysis. Survival curves were elaborated based on Kaplan- Meier estimates of survival functions, and the hazard ratios were obtained using a Cox proportional hazard model. Sur- vivalcurveswerevisuallyexaminedtoconfirmthattherewere no apparent violations of the proportional hazard assump- tion. The exploratory end points of time to discharge from hos- pital, time to recovery, and time to improvement of at least 2 levels in clinical status up to day 29 were analyzed based on Cox-proportional hazards model adjusted by region and base- line clinical status. Baseline demographic and clinical charac- teristics of the patients, the evolution of serum levels of mark- ers of inflammation, and other exploratory outcomes were summarized and presented using descriptive statistics. SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc) was used for the analy- sis of this study. Results Trial Population From 477 patients screened from April to August 2020, 454 adult patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 were en- rolled and randomized (Figure 1). Six randomized patients dis- continued the study before receiving study drug: 3 withdrew their consent to participate immediately after randomization and 3 did not meet eligibility criteria. In total, 448 patients re- ceived canakinumab (n = 225) or placebo (n = 223). Figure 2.

Data markers represent censoring times. A and B, Patients were censored after day 29 or at the last follow-up if they discontinued the study; C, patients who died were not censored up to day 29. By day 29, 12 patients died in the canakinumab group and 16 in the placebo group. Most patients completed the observation period of 29 days, and therefore the median observation time was 29 days. Of note, 14 patients were readmitted to the hospital after discharge: 8 in the canakinumab group and 6 in the placebo group. The median time to hospital discharge was 10 days (95% CI, 9-12) for the canakinumab group and 11 days (95% CI, 10-12) for the placebo group.

Most patients were receiving oxygen therapy by mask or nasal prongs at baseline. By day 29, 80 of 227 patients (35.2%) in the canakinumab group vs 68 of 224 (30.4%) in the placebo group had no clinical or virologic evidence of infection (clinical status of 0). On day 29, the proportion of patients with clinical status of 5 to 8 (ie, patients who needed noninvasive mechanical ventilation, high-flow oxygen, or IMV or who died) was 20 of 227 (8.8%) in the canakinumab group vs 29 of 224 (13%) in the placebo group. The propor- tion of patients remaining hospitalized on day 29 was 12 of 227 (5.3%) in the canakinumab group vs 19 of 227 (8.4%) in the placebo group. No significant differences in the rate of hospital discharge over time were observed between the 2 groups (Figure 2). Additional predefined exploratory efficacy outcomes are reported in eAppendix 2 and the eFigure in Supplement 3. Serum Concentrations of Inflammatory Markers Over Time CRP, ferritin, and D-dimer levels over time in patients treated with canakinumab and placebo are shown in Figure 4. Adverse Events The rate of AEs observed in the canakinumab and placebo groups are shown in Table 2. Most AEs until day 29 were con- sidered to be related to the underlying condition and not re- lated to study drug. Administration of study drug was discontinued in 1 patient who experienced erythema during canakinumab infusion, resolving 1 day later. AEs of infections and infesta- tions were numerically less frequent in the canakinumab group than in the placebo group. Serious AEs were observed in 36 of 225 patients (16%) treated with canakinumab vs 46 of 223 (20.6%) who received placebo. Fatal AEs (COVID-19– related or not related) with onset before day 29 occurred in 17 of 225 patients (7.6%) in the canakinumab group vs 21 of 223 (9.4%) in the placebo group.

Discussion In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ran- domized clinical trial conducted at 39 hospitals in Europe and the United States, the IL-1β inhibitor canakinumab did not sig- nificantly increase the likelihood of survival without IMV amongpatientshospitalizedwithsevereCOVID-19.Thesefind- ings were also consistent for the secondary outcome of COVID- 19–related mortality.

Early during the pandemic and at the time of study de- sign, the results of case-control studies with the IL-1 blocker anakinrafurthersupportedthishypothesis. However,morere- cently, a randomized trial with anakinra was stopped early be- cause of the observed lack of efficacy in decreasing the need for IMV or death.18-25 At the time of study design, there were limited data available to estimate the rate of disease progres- sionafterhospitaladmissionforpatientswithCOVID-19.Based on the early literature, the IMV-free survival rate in the target population was considered most likely in the range from 20% to 50%.1,26,27 A difference of 15% in the primary end point was defined as the minimum clinically meaningful benefit of in- terest at the time of protocol development early in the pan- demic. However, observed event rates in the study were 11.2% and 14.3% in the canakinumab and placebo groups, respec- tively. Because a 15% difference was not achievable, the re- sults should be interpreted based on the observed effect size and confidence interval. Strict criteria for selecting patients with COVID-19 and sys- temic hyperinflammation were not available at the time that this study was designed and conducted. These criteria con- tinue to be refined.28 The AE rates were numerically similar for the canakinumab and placebo groups. Limitations This study had several limitations. First, the standard care for treatment of COVID-19 evolved during the conduct of the trial. In terms of glucocorticoids, prior to study therapy, more patients in the canakinumab group had received dexa- methasone (or equivalent), but this imbalance was reversed after study therapy was administered when more patients receiving placebo initiated dexamethasone (or equivalent) than those in the canakinumab group. Second, there was an imbalance in the use of the prohibited medications (tocili- zumab and anakinra) after study therapy was initiated; these medications were not defined as rescue therapies per protocol. Third, throughout the course of the pandemic, the mortality and morbidity outcomes continued to become increasingly more favorable, likely due to a better under- standing of the disease and its management (ie, standard care treatment).1-3 These challenges underscore the diffi- culty in conducting randomized clinical trials in the chang- ing treatment approach during the COVID-19 pandemic. These shortcomings may be best addressed in the future by event-driven trial designs. Conclusions Among patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19, treat- ment with canakinumab, compared with placebo, did not significantly increase the likelihood of survival without IMV at day 29.

This problem  doesn’t apply to randomised trials  because people are classified based on  the treatment duration they are  assigned, rather than the treatment  duration that they achieve. This  approach accepts that dead people do  not deviate from their assigned  treatment strategy. By transferring this  insight to the analysis of observational  data, we can follow three steps to  estimate the effect of treatment  duration from observational data  without the bias of naive comparisons  between long term and short term  users. The first step is cloning people to  assign them to multiple treatment  strategies. The second step is  censoring clones when they deviate  from their assigned treatment strategy.  The third step is performing inverse  probability weighting to adjust for the  potential selection bias introduced by  censoring. The procedure can be used  to compare any treatment strategies  that are sustained over time. Cloning,  censoring, and weighting eliminates  immortal time bias in the estimates of  absolute and relative risk, which helps  researchers focus their attention on  other biases that may be present in  observational analyses and are not so  easily eliminated. Introduction Quantifying the effect of treatment duration on survival  outcomes is not straightforward because only people  who survive for a long time can receive a treatment for  a long time. Suppose we want to estimate the effect of  statins on the mortality of patients with cancer using  a healthcare database.1 A direct comparison of long  term users, short term users, and non-users would be  biased because long term users have, by definition,  survived for a long time. Several methods can be used  to tackle this bias, but some do not enable estimation  of absolute risks or appropriate adjustment for time  varying confounders. To overcome these limitations, I  first review an uncontroversial approach to estimating  the effect of treatment duration in randomised trials  and then explain how to emulate this approach in  observational data analyses. Estimating the effect of treatment duration in a  randomised trial with full adherence Let us consider a simple example that encapsulates  some key features of the problem. Table 1 shows data  from a trial with perfect adherence and no loss to  follow-up, in which 12 people are randomly assigned  to one of three treatment strategies: no aspirin  (durA=0), one year of aspirin (durA=1), or two years of  aspirin (durA=2). Treatment duration did not affect survival at any  time in this trial. Under each of the strategies, 25% of  people had died by the end of the first year and 75%  by the end of the second year. The two year risk ratio  for durA=2 compared with durA=0 is 0.75/0.75=1. To  avoid statistical considerations, which are not central  to our discussion about systematic bias, we will view  each person in table 1 as representing a million people  with the same data, so that the 95% confidence interval  around this null estimate is very narrow. Suppose that we naively compare the probability of  death between people who actually took aspirin for  two years (two thirds because there are two deaths  among three people (9, 10, 11) after excluding the  Departments of Epidemiology  and Biostatistics, Harvard T H  Chan School of Public Health,  Harvard-MIT Division of Health  Sciences of Technology, Boston,  Massachusetts, MA 02115,  USA Correspondence to: M A Hernán  miguel_hernan@post.harvard.edu Additional material is published  online only.

The ratio (2/3)/(3/4) is <1, even  though we know that treatment had no effect. This is  not surprising: the average survival is longer in people  who received two years of treatment because they  were alive for at least two years. By definition, people  receiving treatment were “immortal” during those two  years, which is why the bias of this naive analysis is  referred to as immortal time bias.2 This analysis fails to acknowledge a simple fact  about the people assigned to two years of treatment  who died during the first year: they did not deviate  from their assigned treatment strategy, they just  happened to die while following their assigned  strategy. In a misguided attempt to correct for non- existing non-adherence,3 the naive analysis introduces  bias. By contrast, the valid analysis accepts that dead  people necessarily stop receiving treatment, regardless  of the treatment duration they were assigned to. We  now need to transfer these insights to the analysis of  observational data. Emulating a randomised trial with full adherence using  observational data Suppose we want to estimate the effect of treatment  duration using a healthcare database with 12 people.  Table 1 shows the data, but we exclude column  durA because observational datasets don’t show the  treatment duration, if any, that patients were assigned  at time zero.4 For simplicity, we still view each person  as representing a million and assume no confounding— people who do and do not receive aspirin at each time  have similar prognostic factors. For the data from a randomised trial, the two year  mortality risk ratio for two years of aspirin compared  with no aspirin was 1. So it should also be 1 in an  unconfounded observational study. But the lack  of the variable durA in the observational dataset  precludes us from performing the valid analysis we  used for the randomised trial. The lack of this variable  makes observational analyses susceptible to naive  comparisons, such as comparing people who received  two years of treatment with those who received  no treatment. This comparison was biased in the  randomised trial and will be biased in an observational  analysis. We can emulate the valid analysis of the randomised  trial using the observational data in three steps— cloning, censoring, and weighting. Cloning: assign people to a treatment strategy at  time zero The solution to the problem created by the lack of the  durA variable is surprisingly simple: create it. Person 1  in table 1 did not receive treatment at time zero, so can  be assigned to the strategy durA=0. Person 5 did receive  treatment at time zero, so could be assigned to either  durA=1 or the durA=2. Randomly assigning the person to  one of these strategies would be statistically inefficient.  Rather, we assign person 5 to both durA=1 and durA=2.  Note that looking at the strategy a person ended up  following is not a valid way to assign people to strategies  at time zero—it will introduce immortal time bias. We assign each person to all treatment strategies that  are compatible with their observed data at time zero.  Assigning a person to two strategies simultaneously is  equivalent to having two copies (or clones) of the person  in the dataset, with each copy assigned to a different  strategy.5 In our example, we create a dataset with two  clones of each person who received treatment at time  zero. We assign one clone to durA=1 and the other to  durA=2. Table 2 shows the expanded population with  eight clones in each of these two groups. Censoring: ensure that people follow their assigned  strategy after time zero If clones deviate from their assigned strategy during  follow-up, we artificially censor them. At one year,  clones assigned to durA=1 will be censored if they  receive treatment at that time, and clones assigned  to durA=2 will be censored if they do not. For our  example, three clones in each durA=1 and durA=2 are  censored because they deviated from their assigned  strategy (table 2). But comparing the two year risk of death for durA=2  with that for durA=0 among uncensored people is still  biased. To see why, look at the five uncensored clones  in durA=2 (8b, 9b, 10b, 11b, and 12b). We know from  table 1 that the two year risk of death in patients who  receive two years of aspirin should be 0.75, but the  Table1 | Hypothetical randomised trial in which 12 people are randomly assigned to one of three treatment durations of aspirin: no aspirin (durA=0),  one year (durA=1), two years (durA=2).

The ratio  0.80/0.75 does not equal the true risk ratio of 1. Even  though cloning has eliminated the immortal time bias,  artificial censoring has introduced selection bias.6 Weighting: adjust for selection bias To eliminate the selection bias due to artificial  censoring, we can use inverse probability weighting.7  8 Informally, uncensored individuals receive a weight  equal to the inverse of their probability of being  uncensored. In other words, people who are censored  transfer their weight in the analysis to those who are  uncensored. The goal is to construct a hypothetical  population in which nobody is censored because  everybody followed their assigned strategy. Clones assigned to the strategy durA=0 are never  artificially  censored:  their  probability  of  being  uncensored is 1 and their inverse probability weight  is 1/1. Clones assigned to durA=2 are not artificially  censored if they died during the first year or survived  the first year and received treatment at the start of the  second year, because in both cases they adhered to their  strategy. That is, the probability of being uncensored is 1  for those who died during the first year (clones 8b, 12b),  and 3/6=0.5 for the others (clones 5b, 6b, 7b, 9b, 10b,  11b). For the five uncensored clones assigned to durA=2,  the inverse probability weight is 1 if they died during the  first year and 1/0.5=2 if they survived the first year. We can now proceed to carry out the same valid  analysis as in the randomised trial, with all nine  uncensored clones (four in durA=0 and five in durA=2)  weighted by their respective inverse probability weight.  The weighted two year mortality risk ratio for durA=2  compared with durA=0 is (6/8)/(3/4)=1. No bias. We  are done. Conclusions The three steps described here—cloning, censoring,  and weighting—can be used to estimate the effect of  treatment duration on survival outcomes when using  observational data (fig 1). Cloning is used to assign  people to treatment duration strategies at time zero,  eliminating immortal time bias.9 10 Artificial censoring  ensures that the clones follow their assigned strategy  through follow-up. It introduces selection bias, which  can be eliminated with inverse probability weighting. Table 1 shows a simple example—two time points,  a null causal effect of treatment, no confounding, and  no losses to follow-up—to show the immortal time bias  arising from a naive observational analysis and how  the three step procedure prevents this bias and yields  absolute risks. The procedure can be extended to  situations with multiple time points and confounding  in which people may start and stop treatment and be  lost to follow-up. When confounding and other biases  (such as selection bias due to losses from follow-up)  exist, additional adjustment using inverse probability  weighting is required, as has been described in  multiple applications in clinical research.11-13 Validity  of the observational estimates relies on the assumption  that all time fixed and time varying confounders are  correctly measured and adjusted for. As well as preventing immortal time bias, the three  step procedure can estimate absolute risks and can  incorporate appropriate adjustment for time varying  confounders.6 7 Neither of these can be achieved with  Table2 | Data from a hypothetical observational study of 12 people Person/clone durA Aspirin at start   of first year  Dead at end   of first year  Aspirin at start   of second year  Dead at end   of second year  Inverse probability   weight 1 0 No No No No 1 2 0 No No No Yes  1 3 0 No No No Yes 1 4 0 No Yes  - Yes 1 5a 1 Yes No No No 2 6a 1 Yes No No Yes 2 7a 1 Yes No No Yes 2 8a 1 Yes Yes  - Yes  1 9a 1 Yes No Yes Censored 0 10a 1 Yes No Yes Censored 0 11a 1 Yes No Yes Censored 0 12a 1 Yes Yes - Yes 1 5b 2 Yes No No Censored 0 6b 2 Yes No No Censored 0 7b 2 Yes No No Censored 0 8b 2 Yes Yes  - Yes 1 9b 2 Yes No Yes No 2 10b 2 Yes No Yes Yes 2 11b 2 Yes No Yes Yes 2 12b 2 Yes Yes - Yes 1 1 2 3 Goal Assign each individual to every strategy consistent with her data at time zero End follow-up when an individual’s data stop being consistent with her assigned strategy Adjust for selection bias introduced by the previous step Method Cloning Censoring IP weighting Step Fig1 | Three step procedure to compare sustained  treatment strategies using observational data.

More generally, the three step procedure can be used  to compare any treatment strategies that are sustained  over time,14 of which treatment duration strategies (in  which we explicitly specify the duration of treatment)  are a simple class. In clinical practice, we often consider  sustained strategies in which treatment decisions at  each time depend on the patient’s evolving clinical  history; for example, “increase the dose of epoetin by  10% if haemoglobin drops below 10 g/dL.” The three  step procedure has been used in these more complex  settings (box 1). The underlying principle is that an  observational analysis needs to explicitly emulate a  (hypothetical) target trial in which eligible people are  assigned to different strategies at time zero.15 An alternative to cloning, censoring, and weighting  that eliminates immortal time bias, estimates absolute  risks, and adequately handles treatment confounder  feedback is Robins’s g formula.4 Unlike the g formula,  however, the three step method can be easily  implemented using standard statistical software, even  for longitudinal data. The data management required  for cloning and censoring can be accomplished with  a few lines of code, and inverse probability weighting  is typically based on the probabilities predicted by  a standard logistic regression model. By contrast,  applying the g formula with time varying confounders  requires some programming and the fitting of multiple  models. In summary, cloning, censoring, and weighting  eliminates immortal time bias in the estimates of  absolute and relative risk, which helps researchers  focus their attention on other biases that may be  present in observational analyses and are not so easily  eliminated.

Methods Eighty-eight participants with aMCI underwent brain amyloid PET and MRI scans and were classiﬁed as early AD (Amy+), SNAP (Amy−), or other neurological/psychiatric diagnosis (Amy−). We focused on SI on the Loewenstein-Acevedo Scales for Semantic Interference and Learning (LASSI-L) targeting proactive semantic interference (PSI; old semantic learning interferes with new semantic learning), failure to recover from PSI after an additional learning trial (frPSI), and retroactive semantic interference (new semantic learning interferes with memory for old semantic learning). Results SIs on measures of PSI and frPSI distinguished between Amy+ AD and SNAP and other non- AD cases. PSI and frPSI intrusions evidenced moderately high associations with reduced volumes in the entorhinal cortex, superior temporal regions, and supramarginal gyrus. No such associations were observed in cases with SNAP. Conclusions SIs on the LASSI-L related to PSI and frPSI uniquely diﬀerentiated Amy+ and Amy− participants with aMCI and likely reﬂect deﬁcits with inhibition and source memory in preclinical AD not captured by traditional cognitive measures. This may represent a speciﬁc, noninvasive test suc- cessful at distinguishing cases with true AD from those with SNAP.

Published Ahead of Print on August 3, 2018 as 10.1212/WNL.0000000000006128  There is a critical need to develop disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer disease (AD) before the occurrence of signiﬁcant multisystem degeneration.1–3 Preventing or reducing the ac- cumulation of β-amyloid seems to be a promising target for early therapeutic intervention; however, there is a dearth of cognitive outcome measures associated with this biomarker with suﬃcient sensitivity and speciﬁcity to detect and monitor early cognitive change,4,5 which is ultimately required by the US Food and Drug Administration for drug approval. The use of traditional cognitive assessment paradigms poses a major limitation to the ﬁeld of early detection in that existing instruments are mostly insensitive and not speciﬁc to early cognitive deﬁcits associated with AD.5 We and others have found that the failure to recover from proactive semantic interference (frPSI)6 may be one such cognitive marker of preclinical AD in adults diagnosed with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and is related to volumetric reductions in selectively AD-vulnerable brain regions.7–9 Proactive semantic interference (PSI) is the deleterious eﬀect on the learning of new items caused by previous learning of items in the same semantic cat- egory. frPSI refers to the persistence of PSI eﬀects even when the subject is given additional opportunities to learn the new items. Furthermore, even among cognitively normal elders, frPSI has been associated with increased amyloid load in AD-prone regions.10 Even though intrusion errors on memory tasks have been found to be an important feature in AD,11–13 semantic intrusions on Loewenstein-Acevedo Scales for Semantic In- terference and Learning (LASSI-L) measures sensitive to PSI and frPSI have not been previously investigated in aMCI. Such semantic errors may reﬂect deﬁcits in source monitoring or ﬁltering previously encoded information14,15 and in strategic retrieval of such material,16,17 and we hypothesized that these intrusions might be unique or even speciﬁc to early AD. Methods Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents All participants consented to participate in this Institutional Review Board–approved study. We recruited 88 participants diagnosed with aMCI (50.6% female) from the 1Florida Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center cohort. Mean age of the participants was 72.9 years (SD 7.7, range 56–98 years); the average educational at- tainment was 14.7 years (SD 3.5, range 6–22 years). The mean Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score was 27.4 (SD 2.0, range 23–30). Our aMCI cohort was sub- divided into 3 groups: amyloid-positive (Amy+) participants with aMCI with clinical and MRI ﬁndings typical of AD, amyloid-negative (Amy−) participants with aMCI with clinical and MRI ﬁndings typical of AD meeting criteria for suspected non-Alzheimer pathology (SNAP), and Amy− participants with aMCI with clinical and MRI ﬁndings sug- gestive of a non-AD diagnosis such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), diﬀuse Lewy body disease, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, vascular cognitive impairment, sleep apnea, or a primary psychiatric disorder. All participants were administered a common clinical assess- ment, which included the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale18 and the MMSE.19 Memory and other cognitive com- plaints were assessed by a geriatric psychiatrist (M.G.) with formal training in administering the CDR who was blinded to the neuropsychological test results. The 88 participants were all community-dwelling older adults who were functionally independent, had reliable informants, and did not meet cri- teria for major neurocognitive disorder by DSM-V criteria.20 The clinician scored the global CDR as 0.5 and considered a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) based on their examination, pending the results of neuropsychological testing if there was a notable history of cognitive decline. Subsequently, a standard neuropsychological evaluation was conducted independently of the clinical evaluation. Testing included the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test–Revised (HVLT- R), Delayed Recall Trial,21 Delayed Recall from the Logical Memory subtest of the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center Uniform Dataset,22 Category Fluency,23 the Block Design subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales– Fourth Edition,24 and parts A and B of the Trail Making Test.25 In the current study, we measured the occurrence of semantic intrusions on LASSI-L Cued Recall trials susceptible to PSI, frPSI, and retroactive semantic interference (RSI). We pos- tulated that semantic intrusions on competing list-learning tasks sensitive to PSI and frPSI might better highlight in- hibitory failures and deﬁcits in source memory that are not Glossary AD = Alzheimer disease; aMCI = amnestic mild cognitive impairment; Amy+ = amyloid positive; Amy− = amyloid negative; ANOVA = analysis of variance; CDR = Clinical Dementia Rating; CI = conﬁdence interval; DSM-V = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition; ERC = entorhinal cortex; FDR = false discovery rate; frPSI = failure to recover from proactive semantic interference; FTLD = frontotemporal lobar degeneration; HVLT-R = Hopkins Verbal Learning Test–Revised; LASSI-L = Loewenstein-Acevedo Scales for Semantic Interference and Learning; MCI = mild cognitive impairment; MMSE = Mini-Mental State Examination; PSI = proactive semantic interference; ROC = receiver operator characteristic; RSI = retroactive semantic interference; SNAP = suspected non-Alzheimer pathology; Tukey HSD test = Tukey honestly signiﬁcant diﬀerence test. 2 Neurology | Volume �, Number � | Month 0, 2018 Neurology.org/N Copyright ª 2018 American Academy of Neurology.

Furthermore, we postulated that PSI and frPSI semantic intrusions on the LASSI-L might distinguish individuals with typical Alzheimer pathology (i.e., amyloid positivity) from those with non-Alzheimer pathology. Previous studies suggest that Alzheimer pathology results in a lack of integration of information stored within diﬀerent cortical regions and be- tween cortical and subcortical regions.15 We hypothesized that the resulting distortion of source memory represented by semantic intrusions may be typical and possibly unique in the MCI stages of early AD.17 MRI visual inspection All participants described above underwent structural MRI with a Skyra 3T Siemens MRI (Malvern, PA) at Mount Sinai Medical Center, Miami Beach, FL. The MRI scans were evaluated by visual inspection to assist in determining the etiology of cases of aMCI and quantitatively to obtain volu- metric data for various brain regions. These assessments were performed with a T2-weighted ﬂuid-attenuated inversion re- covery sequence with 5-mm-thick sequential axial slices to assess (1) atrophy in the right and left temporal, parietal, frontal, and occipital lobes; (2) volume of the left and right lateral ventricles and the third ventricles; (3) the occurrence of lacunar infarcts in each hemisphere; (4) large vessel infarcts in each hemisphere; and (5) degree of periventricular and deep white matter hyperintensities within each hemisphere. Using a 3-dimensional magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo sequence with 1-mm-thick coronal slices, we assessed severity of atrophy in the (6) right and left hippocampus and (7) entorhinal cortex (ERC) using susceptibility-weighted intensity sequences (axial slices 5 mm thick) and (8) sulcal hemorrhages, microhemorrhages, and macrohemorrhages in each hemisphere using an integrated impression of all the above assessments. A global impression was determined for each MRI scan as either consistent with a typical AD diagnosis or consistent with an alternative diagnosis such as FTLD, posterior cortical atrophy, and vascular dementia. Amyloid imaging We scanned all participants for a duration of 20 minutes on a Siemens Biograph 16 PET/CT scanner operating in 3-dimensional mode (55 slices per frame, 3-mm slice thick- ness, 128 × 128 matrix) using the following tracers: NeuraCeq ([F-18] ﬂorbetaben; Piramal Imaging, Boston, MA) 300 MBq (78% of the sample) and Amyvid (ﬂorbetapir; Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN) (22% of the sample). Images were obtained from the top of the head to the top of the neck, and CT data were used for initial attenuation correction and image re- construction in the coronal, sagittal, and axial planes. As de- scribed in our previous work,8 the ﬂorbetaben PET/CT scan, including the outline of the skull, was linearly coregistered (i.e., trilinear interpolation) with 12 df onto the T1 image. This registration process ensured that both MRI parcellation and segmentation were the same as the ﬂorbetaben PET/CT image. All amyloid scans were read by an experienced reader (R.D.) who was blinded to diagnosis. In a prior study, this reader had high reliability with an independent neuroradiol- ogist and rated 95 amyloid scans of older adults (20.0% cognitive normal, 17.9% pre-MCI,10 19% early MCI, 15.8% late MCI, and 27.4% dementia). The same reader rated 41 of these scans as Amy+ and 54 of these scans as Amy−. The concordance between the reader and the independent neu- roradiologist was 93.2% for Amy+ scans and 100% for Amy− scans. The 3 cases for which there was disagreement were 3 participants diagnosed as cognitively normal. Diagnostic criteria for Amy+ aMCI-AD (n = 34) The following 5 criteria were used to deﬁne this group: (1) subjective memory concerns, a progressive decline in memory reported by the participant and/or reliable informant, and a clinical course consistent with a diagnosis of AD; (2) global CDR score of 0.5; (3) ≥1 memory measures 1.5 SD below normal limits relative to age- and education-related norms, as described above and comparable to previous studies; (4) ﬁndings of atrophy in medial temporal and/or parietal regions on visual assessment of structural MRI and the absence of non-Alzheimer pathology such as infarcts and of space- occupying lesions; and (5) Amy+ status based on expert visual reading of amyloid PET scan (R.D.) without reference to quantitative amyloid scores, which were not available for all participants. Diagnostic criteria for Amy2 SNAP (n = 29) Classiﬁcation criteria included all items described above for Amy+ aMCI-AD except for item 5; the amyloid status was negative on the basis of expert visual reading of the amyloid PET scan. Diagnostic criteria for Amy2 aMCI non-AD (n = 25) Classiﬁcation criteria included all items described above for Amy− aMCI-AD except that the clinical course was suggestive of a non-AD diagnosis and the MRI ﬁndings were consistent with a non-AD diagnosis. In this group, the following non-AD diagnoses were made: FTLD (n = 3); diﬀuse Lewy body disease (n = 3); cerebral infarctions (n = 4); chronic traumatic encephalopathy (n = 1); major depression, anxiety, or other psychiatric disorder (n = 9); sleep apnea (n = 1); or un- determined non-AD etiology (n = 4). The LASSI-L The LASSI-L is an established cognitive stress test that been validated in both English and Spanish.6,9 It uses controlled learning and cued recall to maximize storage of an initial list of target words representing 3 semantic categories. The speciﬁc elements of the test are described below. The participant is asked to read aloud 15 words presented individually that are fruits, musical instruments, and articles of clothing (5 words per category). In the unlikely event that the person cannot correctly read the word, the examiner reads the word and asks the person to repeat the word. If a person does not know one of the words (also unlikely), the examiner tells Neurology.org/N Neurology | Volume �, Number � | Month 0, 2018 3 Copyright ª 2018 American Academy of Neurology. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited. the person the semantic category to which the word pertains (e.g., “lemon is a fruit”) and asks the person to repeat the word. After reading all 15 words, the person is asked to recall the words. After the free recall trial, the participant is presented with each category cue (e.g., clothing) and is asked to recall the words that belonged to that category (LASSI-L A1). Sub- sequently, there is an additional presentation of the target stimuli for a second learning trial with cued recall to strengthen the acquisition and recall of the list A words. This provides a measure of maximum storage of the to-be-remembered in- formation (LASSI-L A2). A semantically comparable list (i.e., list B) is then presented in the same manner as list A. List B consists of 15 diﬀerent words from list A; however, all list B words belong to 1 of the 3 semantic categories used in list A (i.e., fruits, musical instruments, and articles of clothing). PSI eﬀects are then measured through free recall of the list B words (LASSI-L B1). List B words are presented a second time, fol- lowed by a second category, cued recall trial, which facilitates a measure of recovery from the initial PSI eﬀects (LASSI-L B2). Recovery from PSI is a feature of the LASSI-L that is not assessed by any existing list-learning measure.5 Finally, short- delayed recall of list A provide an index of RSI. Previous studies have demonstrated robust test-retest reliability of the LASSI-L, and classiﬁcation of patients of aMCI vs cognitively normal elderly exceeded 90% accuracy.6,26 Thus, a unique feature of the LASSI-L is the presentation of a second list of words with shared semantic categories that elicit a considerable amount of proactive semantic interference5,6 and is considered a cognitive stress test.5,10 Unlike other memory paradigms, the LASSI-L facilitates the measurement of recovery from PSI eﬀects through a second cued recall trial of competing target words. RSI through cued recall is also assessed. For this study, we focused on semantic intrusion errors made on Cued B1 (subject to PSI), Cued B2 (subject to frPSI), and Short-Delay Cued A (subject to RSI). MRI quantification Eighty-eight of the participants described above (34 Amy+ AD, 29 SNAP, and 25 Amy−) with diﬀerent aMCI etiologies un- derwent MRI scanning with a Siemens Skyra 3T MRI scanner with parcellation obtained using a 3-dimensional T1-weighted sequence (magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo) with 1.0-mm isotropic resolution and MRI quantiﬁcation. Atrophy in Alzheimer signature regions was assessed with FreeSurfer version 5.3 software (surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu).27,28 For this study, we focused on the hippocampus and ERC, because these areas are aﬀected during early AD stages, and other AD- prone regions such as the precuneus, posterior cingulate, su- perior temporal lobule, inferior temporal lobule, temporal pole, superior parietal lobule, inferior parietal lobule, supramarginal gyrus, superior frontal lobule, and rostral middle frontal lobule. Given the high degree of association between corresponding structures in the left and right brain hemispheres, homologous structures (e.g., inferior temporal lobules, precuneus) were combined and normalized with the use of intracranial vol- ume.29 For associations between semantic intrusion errors and brain volumes, we focused on left hemisphere regions because the LASSI-L is a measure that focuses on verbal learning. Statistical analyses Demographic variables were analyzed with a series of analysis of variance (ANOVA) and χ2 models. Following statistically signiﬁcant results at p < 0.05, post hoc tests were conducted with the Tukey honestly signiﬁcant diﬀerence (HSD) test. The number of semantic intrusions on Cued B1, Cued B2, and Short Delay Cued A trials was examined among the 3 groups using ANOVA procedures with post hoc Tukey honestly signiﬁcant diﬀerence tests for comparisons of means. Analysis of covariance models were also used, controlling for baseline diﬀerences in demographic variables. Because ANOVA and analysis of covariance models yielded identical results, only the results of ANOVA models with unadjusted means are presented. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated for the semantic intrusion measures to determine their ability to classify Amy+ cases with MCI from cases with SNAP and to determine their ability to classify Amy+ cases with MCI from Amy− cases without AD. The Youden Index and bootstrapping techniques using 1,000 iterations were also used. Adding demographic measures, intrusion errors, and other LASSI-L measures did not yield any diﬀerences in the area under the ROC curve. Correlation coeﬃcient matrices were constructed to examine semantic intrusion errors in Amy+ aMCI and SNAP (Amy−) aMCI groups across AD-vulnerable brain regions. For each separate intrusion measure, we controlled for false discovery rate (FDR).30 Data availability Anonymized data not published within this article will be made available by request from any qualiﬁed investigator. Results The aMCI non-AD Amy− group members on average were ≥6 years younger than the aMCI Amy+ participants and those with SNAP (F2,86 = 7.43, p ≤ 0.001). In addition, the Amy+ group had lower MMSE scores than individuals in the other study conditions (F2,86 = 6.58, p = 0.002). Group diﬀerences in primary language in which participants were evaluated (English vs Spanish revealed a greater number of Amy− cases with non- AD MCI who were evaluated in Spanish, χ2 = 8.64, df = 2, p = 0.013) HVLT-R, Category Fluency, and Trail Making Part B, and the standard LASSI-L measures did not diﬀer among the 3 study groups. Group diﬀerences in both hippocampal and ERC volumes were observed (F2,80 = 3.65, p = 0.03 and F2,80 = 3.27, p = 0.03), remaining so after adjustment for baseline covariates. Amy+ participants had lower hippocampal and ERC volumes than Amy−participants with non-AD MCI . Post hoc explor- atory analyses did not reveal group volumetric diﬀerences in other AD-prone regions such as the precuneus, posterior cin- gulate, supramarginal gyrus, inferior and superior parietal lobules, inferior and superior temporal lobules, or rostral middle frontal or superior frontal lobules. 4 Neurology | Volume �, Number � | Month 0, 2018 Neurology.org/N Copyright ª 2018 American Academy of Neurology.

There were diﬀerences between groups with regard to PSI semantic intrusions (F2,85 = 10.79, p < 0.001), frPSI intrusions (F2,85 = 10.06, p = 001), and RSI intrusions (F2,85 = 6.94, p = 0.002) (tables 1 and 2). Post hoc comparison of means for PSI and frPSI intrusions with the Tukey honestly signiﬁcant dif- ference procedure indicated that Amy+ participants com- mitted a signiﬁcantly higher number of PSI, frPSI, and RSI semantic intrusion errors than did participants in the 2 other study groups. We ran additional analyses adjusting for age, MMSE score, and primary education using ERC volume as covariates and obtained similar results. ROC analyses were conducted for frPSI and PSI intrusions to determine how they distinguished between Amy+ MCI-AD and other diagnostic groups. Amy+ participants with MCI-AD vs Amy2 participants with MCI non-AD For Cued B2 intrusions (frPSI), ROC analyses for the MCI Amy+ group vs the aMCI non-AD Amy− group yielded an area under the ROC curve of 0.77 (SE 0.06, p < 0.001) (ﬁgure) with a binomial exact 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) ranging from 0.64 to 0.87.

After adjustment for the FDR, statistically signiﬁ- cant associations remained between PSI and frPSI and vol- umes of the ERC, supramarginal gyrus, and superior temporal regions, with correlation coeﬃcients ranging from r = −0.44 to −0.51 (table 3). The number of RSI intrusions was correlated with supramarginal gyrus volume (r = −0.45). No other associations survived correction for the FDR. No statistically signiﬁcant associations linked semantic intrusion measures and any MRI regional volume in Amy− cases with SNAP. Similarly, in the non-AD Amy− group, after correction for FDR, we found no statistically signiﬁcant associations be- tween semantic intrusion measures and any MRI regional volumes. Discussion Identifying a reliable and inexpensive clinical marker of am- yloid positivity among at-risk individuals would allow re- cruitment of trial-worthy participants in AD clinical trials much more eﬃciently than is currently possible. In addition, this may be useful for clinicians who do not have access to amyloid imaging. This study evaluated whether the presence and number of semantic intrusions on a memory test could diﬀerentiate between Amy+ and Amy− cases of aMCI. We have provided strong evidence that semantic intrusions re- lated to PSI and frPSI on a cognitive stress test (the LASSI-L) successfully and accurately diﬀerentiated patients with aMCI who were Amy+ (and presumably had underlying prodromal AD) from those with aMCI with a clinical course and MRI ﬁndings suggestive of AD who were Amy− (classiﬁed as SNAP). The severity of these intrusions also diﬀerentiated Amy+ patients with aMCI from Amy− patients with aMCI with non–AD-like conditions such as FTLD, vascular cogni- tive impairment, and other neuropsychiatric conditions. No- tably, these ﬁndings were obtained even though there were no diﬀerences in the severity of memory deﬁcits for each aMCI group (e.g., HVLT-R total score) and after statistical adjust- ment for demographic and global mental status diﬀerences between study groups. While Amy+ participants with aMCI had lower hippocampal and ERC volumes than the Amy− groups with other non-AD clinically diagnosed pathology, no other reductions in brain volumes in regions vulnerable to AD pathology distinguished the Amy+ aMCI group from the 2 Amy− groups. Even after statistical adjustment for hippocampal and ERC volumetric diﬀerences and the other aforementioned covariates, Amy+ participants with aMCI had a signiﬁcantly greater number of semantic intrusion errors related to proactive interference than did the 2 other nonamyloid diagnostic groups. The current investigation highlights the importance of considering cognitive stress tests such as the LASSI-L, which in other laboratories has outperformed the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test in MCI-AD groups conﬁrmed by ROC analyses.31 Indeed, S´anchez et al.32 recently found that 50% of asymptomatic middle-aged children of parents with late-onset AD had intrusion errors on PSI trials of the LASSI-L and that these errors were associated with lack of connectivity between AD-prone regions on fMRI. Currently, treatment development for AD is based primarily on using the amyloid hypothesis to identify individuals who are Amy+ and are either preclinical or in a very early stage of the disease. Therefore, the design of clinical trials to prevent or modify the course of AD requires the recruitment of par- ticipants who are cognitively normal or are very mildly im- paired and are Amy+. The ﬁndings in this study suggest that the frequency of semantic intrusions on a memory test such as the LASSI-L would serve well as an inexpensive and readily available clinical marker with potentially high speciﬁcity for predicting amyloid positivity among participants being recruited for an AD clinical trial. At the very least, pending additional studies, it could help to screen for people to scan for entry to a therapeutic intervention. Simons and Spiers33 postulated that the medial temporal and medial orbital and other frontal regions are responsible for dis- crete and elaborate representations of to-be-remembered targets involved in the learning process and source memory.34,35 Re- cently, the supramarginal gyrus has also been implicated in verbal working memory.36 These areas work together to reactivate, monitor, and diﬀerentiate semantic associations and repre- sentations, and damage to this system may lead to semantic intrusion errors.36–38 Indeed, both PSI and frPSI intrusions in Amy+ participants with aMCI were related to reduced left ERC, superior temporal, and supramarginal gyrus volumes, although among the Amy− groups, there was no association between the number of semantic intrusions and ERC volumes. These se- mantic intrusions may not be solely related to structural brain loss. Tau deposition and dendritic excitability in persons with early AD likely have a key role in synaptic plasticity, and aberrant dendritic morphology and ion channel activity contribute to hyperexcitability signaling and disruption of neuronal circuits.38 While semantic intrusions have been previously reported in early AD13,14 and have even diﬀerentiated AD and vascular groups,39 this study is the ﬁrst to provide evidence that se- mantic errors on cognitive stress tests such as the LASSI-L are more prevalent in patients with aMCI-AD who are Amy+ than they are in patients with SNAP who have the clinical features of AD but are Amy− or other neurological psychiatric conditions that clearly are not related to AD (and conﬁrmed as Amy−). The present investigation conﬁrms our clinical experience that the presence of semantic intrusions on cog- nitive stress tests distinguishes those who are completely cognitively normal from those with subtle cognitive impair- ment but who would otherwise be classiﬁed as cognitively unimpaired if only correct responses were taken into account. About 75% to 80% of these semantic intrusions consist of words recalled from a competing word list on the LASSI-L, while 20% to 25% of these intrusions were semantically re- lated items that were not on a competing list of target items. These semantic intrusions clearly represent impairment in Neurology.org/N Neurology | Volume �, Number � | Month 0, 2018 7 Copyright ª 2018 American Academy of Neurology.

Strengths of this study included the use of detailed, well- established, and standardized operational criteria in the eval- uation and diagnosis of patients with aMCI, the availability of both expert readings of amyloid positivity (with highly reliable independent neuroradiological ratings) and volumetric MRI data for these participants, and adjustment for FDRs to control for spurious errors of inference. Limitations include potential bias of those individuals who are self-selected to participate in the 1Florida Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center and undergo amyloid scans and that there were some Amy+ individuals who were not identiﬁed by PSI semantic intrusion errors. Just as we were able to assemble a group of patients with SNAP aMCI who presented clinically with an AD phenotype but were Amy−, it would also be beneﬁcial to have larger homogeneous groups of participants with FTLD or diﬀuse Lewy body disease or participants with cerebro- vascular disease who were Amy−. As in any study, the results of ROC analyses always produce the possibility of overﬁtting the model despite our use of CIs and bootstrapping to obtain a range of cut points. Therefore, these results should be considered preliminary and subject to independent replica- tion. Our ongoing longitudinal studies will further elucidate the predictive utility of these types of measures with regard to progression, disease speciﬁcity, and ultimately response to new emerging treatments.

Stenson, MD1, Mark Donoghoe, PhD2, Peter Brocklehurst, MB, ChB3, Peter G. Davis, MD4, Edmund Juszczak, MSc5, Ian C. Marschner, PhD2,6, John Simes, MD2, and William O. Tarnow-Mordi, MB, ChB2 Infants in the Australian and UK Beneﬁts of Oxygen Saturation Targeting-II trials treated using revised oximeters spent more time within their planned pulse oximeter saturation target ranges than infants treated using the original oximeters (P < .001). This may explain the larger mortality difference seen with revised oximeters. If so, average treatment effects from the Neonatal Oxygen Prospective Meta-analysis trials may be underestimates. (J Pediatr 2018;■■:■■-■■). T he 5 Neonatal Oxygen Prospective Meta-analysis (NeOProM) trials evaluated the effects, in infants born extremely preterm, of targeting lower (85%-89%) vs higher (91%-95%) pulse oximeter saturation (SpO2) on death or disability.1 A meta-analysis shows that for every 1000 infants, targeting lower vs higher SpO2 led to no difference in the primary composite outcome of death or major disability up to 18-24 months and no difference in major disability, includ- ing blindness, but resulted in 28 more deaths, 22 more infants with necrotizing enterocolitis, but 42 fewer infants receiving treatment for retinopathy of prematurity.2 A challenge in analyzing the trials was the discovery in 2011 of an artifact in the study oximeters’ calibration.3 Down- loaded SpO2 values from Masimo oximeters in 176 infants born preterm in 35 neonatal units had a nonphysiological distri- bution with a large dip between 87% and 90% (Figure 1; avail- able at www.jpeds.com). Masimo reported that this reﬂected their decision to adjust the calibration of their oximeters so that at values >87% the displayed SpO2 were increased by 1%-2%.3 As well as fewer values than expected between 87% and 90%, this manufacturer-generated artifact returned more SpO2 values than expected >90%,3 thus affecting both target groups in the NeOProM trials. By elevating SpO2 readings of 88% and 89% to greater displayed values, the artifact would be expected to make the low target group range of 85%-89% narrower and harder to target. By elevating SpO2 values in the range 90%-95% by 1%-2% above the true value the artifact would mean that actual achieved SpO2 values in the high- target range with the original oximeters were lower than in- tended, narrowing the difference in SpO2 between groups. Although the original oximeters performed within re- quired standards for accuracy, at the investigators’ request, Masimo provided revised software restoring the expected SpO2 distribution3,4 and the oximeters were changed to the revised software in 3 of the NeOProM trials.4,5 According to Masimo, oximeters sold since then have incorporated revised software. The effect of the oximeter revision on targeting accuracy and mortality is debated. In an interim safety analysis of the Ben- eﬁts of Oxygen Saturation Targeting (BOOST)-II Australia and UK trials,6 the relative risk of 36-week mortality was in- creased by 65% in low-target vs high-target infants treated using revised oximeters (21.8% vs 13.3%; P < .001) but was not sig- niﬁcantly different in low-target vs high-target infants treated using original oximeters (test for interaction between results for revised and original oximeters P = .006). Each trial was stopped early to prevent avoidable deaths that might occur with continuing enrollment.6 Whyte et al found no difference in targeting accuracy between original and revised oximeters in the BOOST-II trials,4,7,8 as measured by the difference in the median of the median SpO2 distributions for the low- and high-target groups.9 They con- cluded that decisions about optimal SpO2 targets should not be restricted to data obtained with revised oximeters.9 However, an infant’s median SpO2 value does not describe the time they spent in their intended SpO2 target range, which is a more meaningful measure of targeting accuracy. We now report an infant-speciﬁc analysis of time spent in the intended SpO2 target ranges among infants managed using original and revised oximeters in the BOOST-II Australia and BOOST-II UK trials. Methods For each of the 2096 infants in the BOOST II Australia and UK trials for whom oxygen saturation data were available, we calculated the percentage of all time on the oximeter that the BOOST Beneﬁts of Oxygen Saturation Targeting NeOProM Neonatal Oxygen Prospective Meta-analysis SpO2 Pulse oximeter saturation From the 1Neonatal Unit, Royal Inﬁrmary of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom; 2NHMRC Clinical Trials Centre, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia; 3Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom; 4The Royal Women’s Hospital, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The University of Melbourne; Murdoch Children’s Research Institute Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia; 5National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit Clinical Trials Unit, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom; and 6Department of Statistics, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, Australia The authors declare no conﬂicts of interest. 0022-3476/$ - see front matter. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We then determined the pro- portion of time that each infant spent in the low- and high- target ranges. Using these infant-speciﬁc proportions, within each randomized treatment group we calculated the differ- ence between the original and revised oximeters in the mean proportion of time spent in each range, stratiﬁed by trial. For the low-target range, the net improvement in targeting was deﬁned as the increase in the mean proportion of time spent in that range by infants in the low-target group minus any in- crease in the time spent in that range by infants in the high- target group. Similarly, the net improvement in targeting of the high-target range was deﬁned as the difference between the increase in time for infants allocated to the high-target group and the increase for infants in the low-target group. The overall improvement in targeting was then deﬁned as the sum of these 2 improvements. Because the infant-speciﬁc proportions of time spent in each range must lie between 0% and 100%, and because the times in the low- and high-target ranges for a particular infant are not independent, the assumptions required by standard para- metric statistical methods do not hold. Therefore, we used non- parametric methods to draw inferences from these data. To estimate nonparametric 95% CIs for the values of in- terest, we used bootstrapping10—randomly sampling infants from the original data with replacement mimics the process of sampling from the population—and we repeated this 10 000 times. By calculating the targeting improvements in each of these 10 000 resampled datasets, we obtained a distribution of “bootstrapped” parameter estimates, from which we ob- tained a plausible range for the true parameter of interest. Nonparametric 2-sided P values were calculated by con- ducting permutation tests.11,12 This approach is based on the fact that we can produce a dataset in which we know the null hypothesis of no software effect is true by randomly shuf- ﬂing the software labels between infants from the original dataset. We did this 10 000 times, allowing us to estimate the distribution of targeting improvements that could be observed if the null hypothesis were true. The P value is then the proportion of times that the magnitude of the targeting improvements calculated from the permuted datasets ex- ceeded that observed in the original data. Results SpO2 data were available for 1128 of 1135 infants in BOOST- II Australia and for 968 of 973 infants in BOOST-II UK. Low- target group infants in BOOST-II Australia treated using revised oximeters spent 5.8% more time in the low SpO2 range of 85%- 89% than those using the original oximeters. Similarly, in BOOST-II UK low-target infants treated using revised oximeters spent 5.3% more time in the low SpO2 range of 85%-89% than those using the original oximeters. High-target infants treated with revised oximeters spent 3.3% and 1.7% longer in the low SpO2 range than high-target infants treated with the original oximeters in the Australia and UK studies, respectively, leading to a pooled net improvement of 2.9% (95% CI 1.4%-4.4%; P < .001) in targeting the low range using revised oximeters across the 2 trials (Table I and Figure 2). In BOOST-II Australia, high-target infants treated using revised oximeters spent 3.2% more time in the high SpO2 range of 91%-95% than those treated using original oximeters, and low-target infants spent 0.1% longer in the high SpO2 range, giving a net improvement in targeting the high SpO2 range of 3.1%. In BOOST II UK, high-target infants treated using revised oximeters spent 4.5% less time in the high range than those using original oximeters, and low-target infants spent 2.2% less time in that range, giving a net deterioration in targeting ac- curacy of 2.2%. Pooling the data stratiﬁed by trial gave a net improvement in targeting the high-target range of 1.0% (95% CI 1.0% deterioration to 3.0% improvement; P = .322). The combined net improvement of proportion of time spent in correct target range across both low- and high-target ranges associated with revised oximeters was 3.9% (95% CI 1.6%- 6.2%; P < .001).

In relative terms, using revised vs original oximeters, low-target infants spent 30%-40% more time in the low-target range in the 2 trials. Discussion We have shown that the revision of the oximeter calibration software in the BOOST-II Australia and BOOST-II UK trials improved SpO2 targeting. This was mainly because the low- target infants on revised oximeters spent longer in their in- tended SpO2 range, increasing their exposure to lower SpO2. This may, at least in part, explain the increased differences in mortality observed between randomized groups using revised oximeters2 and suggests that our current assessments of average treatment effects may underestimate the risk of targeting the lower SpO2 range. In pooled analyses of the BOOST-II Australia and BOOST- II UK trials, there was not a statistically signiﬁcant difference in mortality at 2 years between randomization groups with the original oximeters (P = .49),13 but there was a highly statisti- cally signiﬁcant difference in mortality between groups with the revised oximeters (P = .001). The pooled mortality rate of the high-target groups decreased by 1.8% after the oximeter revision. The pooled mortality rate of the low-target groups increased by 7.5% after the oximeter revision. The changes in mortality observed following the oximeter revision were there- fore largely explained by changes in mortality rates in the low- target groups. The small net improvement in the pooled results in target- ing the high SpO2 target range after the oximeter changes was not statistically signiﬁcant. It is important to consider that dis- played values in the higher target range after the oximeter re- vision represent higher true SpO2 readings than similar readings obtained with the original oximeters. The different patterns between the 2 trials in the high-target groups after the revi- sion may be explained by chance. As previously suggested,9 our statistical method used“infant” as the unit of analysis by combining the data for each infant into a summary statistic followed by a comparison between target groups based on the between-infant variation in the summary statistic. Our use of percent time in the target range provides a more relevant metric of targeting accuracy than the median oxygen saturation for each infant previously presented.9 It will be helpful if similar analyses are undertaken on the data from the other oxygen trials.

Lower SpO2 values would be associated with relative hypoxemia whether or not supplemental oxygen was in use and would not result in oxygen supplementation in infants in the low SpO2 target groups. In each trial using revised oximeters (BOOST-II UK,4,7,13 BOOST-II Australia,4,7,13 and the Canadian Oxygen Trial5), the observed risk of death was greater in low-target infants, and the pooled mortality rate was statistically signiﬁcantly greater in low-target infants. A test for interaction showed strong evi- dence (P = .009) that the pooled mortality results were dif- ferent before and after the oximeter change (Figure 3; available at www.jpeds.com). The effect of additional centers joining the BOOST-II UK study is unlikely to explain this difference, as no new centers joined the Australian or Canadian trials after the oximeter revision. However, nurses in the 3 trials may have become better at SpO2 targeting over time,2,9 tending to in- crease the risk of mortality in lower-target infants. If so, this would strengthen the conclusion that spending more time in the lower saturation target increases mortality. The NeOProM trials show collectively, and particularly in the infants who were treated after the revision of the trial oximeters, that small differences in achieved SpO2 distribu- tion can have a signiﬁcant effect on risk of mortality in infants born extremely preterm. Clinicians should understand the per- formance of the oximeters that they use and this would be fa- cilitated if the manufacturers of these devices published details of the calibration of their instruments. In summary, changing the trial oximeters improved target- ing, exposing low-target infants to more time with lower SpO2 (P < .001), which was associated with an increased risk of mor- tality. The improved targeting was captured by measuring time spent in the intended SpO2 target ranges but not by measur- ing the difference in median SpO2.9 Regardless of any effects of changing the oximeters on trial outcomes, the NeOProM trials show that aiming for the lower SpO2 target has no sig- niﬁcant effect on the risk of the composite of death or dis- ability, on disability or on blindness but increases the risk of death.2 Any proposed trade-off 2 between the beneﬁts (less treat- ment for retinopathy of prematurity, without differences in blindness or disability) and harms (more deaths and more nec- rotizing enterocolitis) of the low target should be made clear to parents. This information already is changing clinical practice.14 ■ Submitted for publication Nov 30, 2017; last revision received Jul 9, 2018; accepted Aug 15, 2018 Reprint requests: Benjamin Stenson, MD, Neonatal Unit, Royal Inﬁrmary of Edinburgh, Little France Crescent, Edinburgh EH16 4SA, United Kingdom.

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Abstract    Purpose: To assess the impact of a masked Endpoint Committee on estimates of the  incidence of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), treatment efficacy and statistical  power of the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study-Phase 1, 1994-2002 (OHTS-1).    Design: Retrospective inter-rater reliability analysis of endpoint attribution by the  Endpoint Committee     Methods: After study closeout, we re-calculated estimates of endpoint incidence,  treatment efficacy and statistical power using all-cause endpoints and POAG endpoints.   To avoid bias, only the first endpoint per participant is included in this report.    Results: The Endpoint Committee reviewed 267 first endpoints from 1,636 participants.   The Endpoint Committee attributed 58% (155 of 267) of the endpoints to POAG.  The  incidence of all-cause endpoints vs. POAG endpoints was 19.5% and 13.2%  respectively in the observation group and 13.1% and 5.8% respectively in the  medication group.  Treatment effect for all-cause endpoints was a 33% reduction in risk  (relative risk = 0.67, 95% CI of 0.54-0.84) and a 56% reduction in risk for POAG  endpoints (relative risk = 0.44, 95% CI of 0.31-0.61).  Post-hoc statistical power for  detecting treatment effect was 0.94 for all-cause endpoints and 0.99 for POAG  endpoints.    Conclusion: Endpoint Committee adjudication of endpoints improved POAG incidence  estimates, increased statistical power, and increased calculated treatment effect by  23%.  An Endpoint Committee should be considered in therapeutic trials when common  ocular and systemic co-morbidities, other than the target condition, could compromise  study results.

A systematic review of 13 Cochrane  reviews and 9 protocols of glaucoma intervention studies indicates no clear consensus  regarding how best to assess outcomes, making it difficult to compare studies when  there is significant variation.  Of the glaucoma studies reviewed, only 12% used visual  fields and 13% a structural assessment, 62% of which were optic nerve head change.4   Almost all National Eye Institute sponsored clinical trials of ocular hypertension and  glaucoma have used visual fields (VF) as a primary endpoint, including the Advanced  Glaucoma Intervention Study5, Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial6, (EMGT) Collaborative  Initial Glaucoma Treatment Study7 (CIGTS) and The Ocular Hypertension Treatment  Study8 (OHTS).  The EMGT6, CIGTS9 and OHTS8 assessed the optic nerve as well  however only EMGT6 and OHTS8 relied on the optic nerve in addition to the visual field  as primary endpoints.  The importance of evaluating both the visual field and the optic  nerve has been noted by others, particularly when evaluating patients with ocular  hypertension.2, 10  Moreover, using both functional and structural metrics is consistent  with clinical practice.1    However, the assessment of visual field abnormality and optic nerve deterioration is  complicated.  It is well known that other eye conditions such as cataracts, age-related  macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy, which may be more common than  glaucoma in some groups of older adults, can cause visual field loss.11  The task of  distinguishing visual field loss attributable to glaucoma from non-glaucomatous causes  can be daunting.  Similarly, optic disc damage can result from non-glaucomatous  causes such as ischemic optic neuropathy, demyelinating disease, and compressive  optic nerve lesions.  Co-mingling of glaucomatous and non-glaucomatous endpoints in  a clinical trial can cause overestimation of the incidence or progression of glaucoma,  underestimation of treatment effect and/or a loss of statistical power.    The Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study-Phase 1, 1994-2002 (OHTS-1)8 is an  unmasked, randomized trial of the safety and efficacy of ocular hypotensive medication  in preventing or delaying the onset of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG).  The US  Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency recommend  centralized adjudication when endpoints are subjective, require the application of a  complex definition and/or when treatment assignment is not masked.12,13  Thus, to  achieve greater diagnostic specificity of endpoints, the OHTS used a masked Endpoint  Committee to adjudicate whether the cause of reproducible visual field abnormality and  reproducible optic disc deterioration were due to POAG.  This manuscript assesses the  impact of a masked Endpoint Committee adjudication on estimates of POAG  conversion, treatment effect and statistical power.    Methods  OHTS Phase 1 (NCT0000125) was undertaken in accordance with good clinical  practice guidelines and adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki.  The institutional review   MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT   board of each clinic approved the study protocol and consent form.  Participants gave  written informed consent to be screened and, if eligible, to be randomized.    Between February 1994 to October 1996, 1,636 individuals with an intraocular pressure  (IOP) between 24 mmHg and 32 mmHg in one eye and 21 to 32 mm Hg in the fellow  eye and no evidence of glaucomatous damage by standard clinical measures were  randomized to either observation or to treatment with commercially available topical  ocular hypotensive medications.  Neither clinician nor participant was masked to the  randomization assignment.  Reading Centers determined the occurrence of visual field  and optic disc endpoints without regard to cause, “all-cause” endpoints.  The masked  Endpoint Committee determined whether these endpoints were POAG endpoints.  The  primary hypothesis compared the incidence of POAG endpoints in the medication and  observation groups.  A secondary analysis compared incidence of all-cause endpoints  in the randomization groups.  In 2002, the OHTS primary outcome paper13 reported that  ocular hypotensive medication was safe and effective in preventing glaucoma, after  which participants in the observation group were offered ocular hypotensive treatment.   This report includes data to June 2002 when participants were followed according to  their original randomization assignment.    Figure 1 illustrates the flowchart for assessment of endpoints after reading centers  determined the occurrence of a reproducible endpoint and the Coordinating Center  prepared an endpoint chart for Endpoint Committee adjudication.14-16  Criteria for  Reading Center determination of reproducible visual field abnormality and optic disc  deterioration are described briefly below.    A reproducible visual field abnormality was defined as a set of three consecutive,  reliable visual fields with a corrected pattern standard deviation (CPSD) of P < 5% or a  glaucoma hemifield test outside normal limits by STATPAC 2 criteria (Humphrey 30-2)  as judged by masked readers at the Visual Field Reading Center, University of  California-Davis, Sacramento, California, were sent to the Coordinating Center to initiate  the endpoint review process.17,14  Eighty-six percent of the initial visual field  abnormalities were not confirmed on retest and were not sent to Endpoint Committee  for review.  Additional details about the process of reviewing visual fields have been  previously published.15  A reproducible disc deterioration was defined as two  consecutive sets of optic disc photographs judged by masked certified readers at the  Optic Disc Reading Center, Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, Miami, Florida to show  generalized or localized thinning of the optic disc neuroretinal rim compared to baseline  stereoscopic optic disc photographs.  About 18% of the eyes that initially showed disc  deterioration from baseline were not confirmed by retake optic disc photographs and  were not sent to the Endpoint Committee for review (Internal report, August, 2018).   When two consecutive sets of optic disc photographs were judged to show  deterioration, the case was sent to the Coordinating Center to initiate the endpoint  review process.  Additional details about the process of reviewing optic disc  photographs have been previously published.16     MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT   The Coordinating Center prepared a separate masked endpoint chart for each  reproducible visual field abnormality and each reproducible optic disc deterioration.   Each member of the Endpoint Committee received a masked endpoint chart for review.   The endpoint chart included medical and ocular history (all visual fields, all optic disc  photographs, macular and red reflex photographs of both eyes) to date.  The endpoint  chart was masked as to randomization assignment, hypotensive medication use, IOP  and glaucoma surgery.    The masked Endpoint Committee was established to serve as an unbiased clinical  surrogate to adjudicate whether reproducible changes identified by either Reading  Center were due to POAG and to determine whether optic disc deterioration was  clinically significant.  Visual field abnormality was deemed a POAG endpoint based on a  consistent depression in sensitivity in the Pattern Deviation analysis, compatible with  either a nerve fiber bundle defect, paracentral scotoma, or nasal step.  Defects  occurring only at the margins of the visual field were typically considered artifacts unless  there were optic disc changes to corroborate the clinical diagnosis of POAG.    To reflect clinician decision-making, the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee  mandated that the Endpoint Committee determine if optic disc deterioration detected by  the Optic Disc Reading Center met a clinical threshold of conversion to POAG to justify  initiation of treatment.  If the clinical threshold was not met, the Endpoint committee did  not adjudicate cause.  Optic disc deterioration was deemed a POAG endpoint based on  clinically significant changes in the following:  optic disc rim width, the contour of the  disc, or shift of the vessels across the disc rim.  Disc hemorrhage alone was not  considered an endpoint, unless associated with a change in contour.  To mimic clinical  practice, the Endpoint Committee reviewed both the disc and visual field of both eyes in  their adjudication of every endpoint.  If either the optic nerve or visual field endpoint did  not meet these criteria, then the endpoint was rejected and additional testing was  requested.  Ocular media changes or other ocular diagnoses were considered in the  deliberation.  Examples of a visual field and optic nerve change are illustrated at  https://www.vrcc.wustl.edu/ohts/disc/ and https://www.vrcc.wustl.edu/ohts/fields/.    The Endpoint Committee process was consensus-driven.  The members of the  Endpoint Committee (DH, EH and RP), all practicing clinicians, remained active  throughout the study.  Each Endpoint Committee member independently determined  whether an endpoint was “most probably due to POAG” or “most probably not due to  POAG” and, for optic disc deterioration, whether the “change was clinically significant.”   The “Endpoint Form” is posted on https://ohts.wustl.edu/wp- content/uploads/2017/02/A_EN.pdf.  If the first review did not achieve unanimity a  second, independent review was conducted (Figure 1).  If the second review did not  achieve unanimity, a conference call was held.  The target time for reaching unanimity  was 31 days from notification of the Coordinating Center by the Reading Center of a  reproducible change.  The Endpoint Committee also determined if discontinuation of  assessment was necessary when visual fields or optic disc stereo-photographs became  unascertainable for POAG (e.g. after retinal vein occlusion or stroke).     MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT   The first endpoint per participant was selected for inclusion in this report to avoid bias  from subsequent endpoint reviews.  Participants were classified as converting to POAG  if one eye developed a POAG endpoint.  If a POAG endpoint was detected by both  visual fields and by optic disc deterioration on the same visit, one endpoint was selected  randomly.  Participants who developed an endpoint due to causes other than POAG  were classified as developing a non-POAG endpoint.  We evaluated the Endpoint  Committee’s performance and impact as follows:  1. Intergrader agreement among Endpoint Committee members is reported as the  proportion of endpoint reviews in which unanimity was achieved in the first and  second rounds of independent review.  2. The all-cause and POAG endpoints are compared by randomization group and  separately by visual field endpoints and optic disc endpoints.  3. Treatment effect was estimated using a post-hoc Mantel-Haenszel test to calculate  the relative risk of all-cause endpoints and POAG endpoints in the observation and  medication groups.  4. Post-hoc statistical power of the OHTS was estimated using all-cause endpoints and  POAG endpoints assuming a two-sided alpha=0.05 for two-sample proportions test  for a fixed sample of 1,636 participants with no adjustment for censoring.    Results  Data were re-analyzed for this report in 2012.  Over a median follow-up of 7.5 years of  OHTS, the Endpoint Committee reviewed 467 endpoints from 267 participants.  The first  endpoint per participant (n=267) was selected for inclusion in this report to avoid bias  from subsequent reviews.  If both visual field and optic disc endpoints were detected on  the same visit for 5.2% (14 of 267) of the participants, the endpoint was selected  randomly for inclusion in this report.    Inter-grader Agreement  The 3 members of the Endpoint Committee independently reached unanimity in the first  round of review for 61.0% (163 of 267) endpoints, in the second round for 32.2% (86 of  267) endpoints and in a consensus conference call for the remaining 6.7% (18 of 267).   A slightly higher rate of optic disc endpoints required a third round of review 9.6% (13 of  135 compared to 3.8% (5 of 132) of the visual field endpoints.  Mean time to notification  of clinics of Endpoint Committee decision in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd rounds of review were  11.0 + 7.1 SD days, 20.8 + 14.3 SD days and 31.4 + 15.6 SD days respectively.    All-Cause and POAG Endpoints, Treatment Effect and Statistical Power  Overall, 16.3% (267 of 1,636) of the participants developed an endpoint and 9.5% (155  of 1,636) developed a POAG endpoint.  In the observation group, 19.5% (160 of 819) of  the participants developed an endpoint compared to 13.1% (107 of 817) in the  medication group (relative risk = 0.67, 95% CI of 0.54-0.84) – a reduction of 33%.  In the  observation group 13.2% (108 of 819) developed a POAG endpoint compared to 5.8%  (47 of 817) in the medication group (relative risk = 0.44, 95% CI of 0.31-0.61) – a  reduction of 56%.  Post-hoc statistical power for detecting a treatment effect for all  endpoints was 0.94 compared to >0.99 for detecting a treatment effect for POAG  endpoints with the OHTS sample of 1,636 participants (Table 3).   MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT   We found no evidence of bias in the Endpoint Committee’s attribution of endpoints to  “non-POAG” causes by randomization group.  Non-POAG endpoints (n=112) were  approximately equally distributed in both randomization groups, 6.3% (52 of 819) in the  observation group and 7.3% (60 of 817) in the medication group.    Visual Field POAG Endpoints  Of the 132 visual field (VF) endpoints, the Endpoint Committee classified 49% (65 of  132) as “probably due to POAG” and 51% (66 of 132) as “probably not due to POAG”.   One VF endpoint was classified as “no change” (Table 1).  Other causes were recorded  in notes by Endpoint Committee members and are reported in Table 2.  In the  observation group, 9.2% (75/819) of the participants developed a VF endpoint  compared to 7.0% (57/817) in the medication group (relative risk of 0.76, 95% CI of  0.55-1.06) – a risk reduction of 24%.  In the observation group, 5.5% (45/819) of the  participants developed a POAG VF endpoint compared to 2.4% (20/817) in the  medication group (relative risk = 0.44, 95% CI of 0.26-0.75) – a risk reduction of 56%.   Post-hoc statistical power for detecting a treatment effect for all-cause VF endpoints  was 0.37 compared to 0.88 for detecting a treatment effect for POAG VF endpoints with  a fixed sample of 1,636 participants (Table 3).    Optic Disc POAG Endpoints  Of the 135 optic disc endpoints, the Endpoint Committee classified 30.4% (41 of 135) as  “not clinically significant and did not adjudicate cause, 66.7% (90 of 135) were classified  as “clinically significant and due to POAG, 3% (4 of 135) were clinically significant and  not due to POAG (Table 1).  In the observation group, 10.4% (85/819) of the  participants developed an optic disc endpoint compared to 6.1% (50/817) in the  medication group (relative risk of 0.59, 95% CI of 0.42-0.82) – a reduction of 41%.  In  the observation group 7.7% (63/819) of the participants developed a POAG optic disc  endpoint compared to 3.3% (27/817) in the medication group (relative risk = 0.43, 95%  CI of 0.28-0.67) – a reduction of 57%.  Post-hoc statistical power for detecting a  treatment effect for all optic disc endpoints was 0.89 and 0.97 for POAG optic disc  endpoints with a fixed sample of 1,636 participants (Table 3).    Discussion  The Endpoint Committee had a clear impact on the accuracy of estimates of POAG  conversion and treatment effect.  Overall, 16.3% of the participants developed an  endpoint, but only 9.5% of the participants had an endpoint attributed to POAG by the  Endpoint Committee.  The impact of the Endpoint Committee’s determination of POAG  from non-POAG endpoints was most pronounced for VF endpoints.  Eight percent of the  participants developed a VF endpoint, but only 4% developed a VF endpoint attributed  to POAG.  Non-POAG causes of visual field abnormalities such as cataract, lid  abnormalities and neurological disorders (See Table 2) would be expected in a long- term study in older adults.    The US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency  recommend centralized adjudication when endpoints are subjective, require the  application of a complex definition and/or when treatment assignment is not masked.    MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT   To our knowledge, OHTS is the only NIH-sponsored trial in glaucoma to use a masked  Endpoint Committee to adjudicate whether reproducible visual field abnormalities and/or  optic disc deterioration, were due to POAG.  Beyond the field of ophthalmology, the  number of therapeutic trials using Endpoint Committees has increased and best  practice guidelines for their operation have been developed.18-21    Four key components of the Endpoint Committee are:  1. Masking 2. Standardization of  outcome determination over time and across clinics 3. Integrating both functional and  structural tests 4. Requirement of unanimity.  The benefits of the Endpoint Committee  are clear, particularly when considering the removal of non-POAG causes that dilute the  treatment effect.  The calculated treatment effect was greater for POAG endpoints than  for all-cause endpoints because medication has little or no effect on non-POAG  endpoints.  Treatment reduced the estimate of all-cause endpoints by 33% (relative risk  of 0.67) and the estimate of POAG endpoints by 56% (relative risk of 0.44).    In order to make OHTS results more generalizable to clinical practice, the Data and  Safety Monitoring Committee instructed the Endpoint Committee to require optic disc  endpoints to be “clinically significant” in magnitude to justify initiation of treatment.  The  Endpoint Committee classified nearly a third of all optic disc endpoints as “not clinically  significant”, although these endpoints had been documented as reproducible by trained  readers at the Optic Disc Reading Center.  Optic disc endpoints that were judged “not  clinically significant” were not adjudicated as to cause.  Of the “clinically significant”  optic disc endpoints, 97% were attributed to POAG.  This high level of specificity should  not be interpreted as evidence that optic disc endpoints are generally more specific for  POAG than visual field endpoints since adjudication was performed only for the subset  of clinically significant optic disc endpoints.    There are some important considerations in evaluating the benefit and limitations of an  Endpoint Committee.  Not all treatment trials benefit from endpoint adjudication.  In a  review of 10 trials with over 9,000 events from more than 95,000 participants, Pogue  found no difference between adjudicated composite outcomes (cardiovascular death, MI  or stroke) and non-adjudicated outcomes.22  Adjudication may be less critical if study  duration is short, patient sample is homogeneous, outcomes are quantitative and there  are few competing causes of endpoints.2, 3  The use of artificial intelligence and  statistical techniques e.g. PROGRESSOR could increase the certainty of disease  presence/progression in Reading Centers and thereby could increase the certainty of  causal attribution.23  However, given the uncertainty of causal attribution of visual field  abnormality and optic disc deterioration, glaucoma intervention studies can benefit from  a centralized process that drives consensus.  Positioning the Endpoint Committee  review following the Reading Center review mitigated bias and affirmed clinically  relevant endpoints.    A limitation of the OHTS Endpoint review process is related to turnover in Endpoint  Committee membership which could have, but did not, occur during this study.  Thus,  training and certification of Endpoint Committee members should be considered in  future studies.  Moreover, there was no attempt to externally validate the Endpoint   MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT   Committee’s attribution of endpoints to POAG in OHTS.  When competing ocular or  systemic conditions co-occurred with a possible POAG cause, there is a risk that the  attribution process may favor diagnostic specificity and result in an under count of  POAG events.    We conclude that the masked adjudication of endpoints by the Endpoint Committee  increased statistical power and increased the accuracy of estimates of POAG  conversion and treatment effect.  Given the strong effect of treatment in this trial, the  increased power was not critical.  However, in studies where the therapeutic  intervention has a less robust effect, the increased power could be critical.  An Endpoint  Committee should be considered in therapeutic trials when common ocular and  systemic co-morbidities, other than the target condition, could compromise study  results.

F. Thompson, Melanoma Institute Australia, 40 Rocklands Road, North Sydney, New South Wales 2065, Australia (e-mail: john.thompson@melanoma.org.au) Background: Although surgery for early-stage melanoma offers the best chance of cure, recent advances in molecular medicine have revolutionized the management of late-stage melanoma, leading to significant improvements in clinical outcomes. Research into the genomic drivers of disease and cancer immunology has not only ushered in a new era of targeted and immune-based therapies for patients with metastatic melanoma, but has also provided new tools for monitoring disease recurrence and selecting therapeutic strategies. These advances present new opportunities and challenges to the surgeon treating patients with melanoma. Methods: The literature was reviewed to evaluate diagnostic and therapeutic advances in the manage- ment of cutaneous melanoma, and to highlight the impact of these advances on surgical decision-making. Results: Genomic testing is not required in the surgical management of primary melanoma, although it can provide useful information in some situations. Circulating nucleic acids from melanoma cells can be detected in peripheral blood to predict disease recurrence before it manifests clinically, but validation is required before routine clinical application. BRAF mutation testing is the standard of care for all patients with advanced disease to guide therapy, including the planning of surgery in adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings. Conclusion: Surgery remains central for managing primary melanoma, and is an important element of integrated multidisciplinary care in advanced disease, particularly for patients with resectable metastases. The field will undergo further change as clinical trials address the relationships between surgery, radiotherapy and systemic therapy for patients with high-risk, early-stage and advanced melanoma. Paper accepted 10 October 2017 Published online in Wiley Online Library (www.bjs.co.uk). DOI: 10.1002/bjs.10751 Introduction Surgery is the only effective treatment for primary melanoma. For patients with advanced melanoma (unre- sectable lymph node disease or distant metastasis), no effective systemic therapies were available until 20091,2 and the 5-year survival rate was less than 10 per cent3. The past decade has seen the arrival of drug therapies that can offer improved disease control and survival benefit for patients with advanced disease. Research into the genomics of melanoma has underpinned these therapeutic developments, and provides the basis for molecular assays to direct therapy and monitor disease. These new therapies comprise two broad categories: targeted therapy and immunotherapy. Whereas tar- geted therapy blocks specific constitutively activated pathways by mutant oncogenes within melanoma tumour cells, immunotherapy is directed at reversing the immunosuppressive effects of melanoma and re-establishing cytotoxic immune responses against the tumour. Both types of therapy have recently been trialled in adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings, with positive results. This has ushered in an era of increased possibilities and complexity in managing patients with melanoma, in which the surgeon continues to play a key role. This review examines how genomics impacts melanoma surgery through new assays and systemic therapies, focus- ing on areas with the potential to change practice, from early to advanced stage disease. Methods A search was undertaken for reports providing origi- nal data on any aspect of the pathogenesis, diagnosis or © 2018 BJS Society Ltd BJS 2018; 105: e31–e47 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd e32 P. M. Ferguson, G. V. Long, R. A. Scolyer and J. F. Thompson clinical management of cutaneous melanoma published in the English literature during the past two decades (from 1 January 1997 to 20 September 2017). Studies pertaining exclusively to uveal melanoma were excluded. MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, Scopus and Google Scholar databases were searched electronically. All sources were last searched before or on 20 September 2017. The databases were queried using combinations of the follow- ing search terms: ‘melanoma’, ‘genomics’, ‘surgery’, ‘diag- nosis’, ‘targeted therapy’, ‘immune checkpoint inhibitors’, ‘adjuvant’ and ‘neoadjuvant’. Studies were selected for inclusion after an initial screen- ing of titles and abstracts. Additional articles, cited in the screened studies, were also considered. Studies deemed to be of sufficient quality and relevance to the topic were included in this qualitative review. Data were not system- atically or formally extracted, and no meta-analyses were performed. The included studies were organized into five themes spanning primary to advanced melanoma. Genomic applications to the surgical management of primary melanoma Following initial biopsy of a melanocytic lesion, the sur- geon is guided by the histopathology report as to whether sentinel lymph node biopsy is required, as well as wide excision of the primary site. Genomic methods have been developed to provide the surgeon with ancillary information to predict the biological behaviour of the tumour, the risk of sentinel node (SN) positivity, and the assessment of excision margins. These assays range from relatively well established techniques (fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH)) to experimental tests (cyclin D1); however, they are all limited by a lack of formal prospective studies and are not yet part of routine management. Genomic testing of ambiguous primary tumours When provided with an adequate biopsy, the patholo- gist is able to characterize the great majority of cuta- neous lesions as benign or malignant using morphological assessment alone. Occasionally, a melanocytic lesion will show borderline features that make it difficult to classify definitively as a benign naevus or an invasive melanoma (Fig. 1). Molecular studies have revealed that naevi have few genetic alterations, most often limited to point mutations in oncogenes such as BRAF4. In contrast, melanomas have widespread mutations as well as losses and gains of genetic material at the chromosomal level5. This molecular dis- tinction is not as pronounced in histologically ambiguous lesions such as dysplastic naevi and atypical Spitz naevi6,7. Nevertheless, ancillary molecular testing can exploit these differences to assist in the diagnosis of histologically bor- derline tumours. The two best established techniques are FISH, which examines a limited number of specific gene loci, and aCGH, which examines thousands of regions across the genome. The FISH assay applies short fluorescent DNA probes directly to a slide with a paraffin section of melanoma. The tumour DNA is first denatured into single strands, allowing the complementary FISH probes to hybridize. The slide is then examined under a fluorescence microscope and the number of probes in each tumour cell nucleus is counted. A gain of a targeted gene locus is defined as more than two probes per cell in 30 per cent or more of at least 30 counted cells, whereas a loss is fewer than two probes/cell8. Probes labelling centromeres are included as controls to detect changes in whole chromosome numbers (aneuploidy). A five-probe FISH assay delivers 94 per cent sensitivity and 98 per cent specificity for unambiguous melanoma, but data are more limited on the efficacy of such testing in predicting clinical outcomes in histologically ambiguous tumours9. The advantages of FISH are that it requires only a small amount of tumour tissue and allows direct visuaIization of the tumour cells. The disadvantage is that FISH exam- ines only a limited region of the tumour using a small number of probes. In contrast, aCGH uses extracted tumour DNA and a chip containing over 40 000 wells, with each well containing a specific segment of DNA. The tumour DNA and an equal amount of control DNA are labelled with different fluorophores and combined on the chip. The relative binding of the tumour versus control DNA is assessed in each well by image analy- sis, based on the fluorescence. The advantage of aCGH over FISH is its vast coverage and resolution across the genome. The disadvantage is that it is more expensive and labour-intensive, and can produce false-negative results when the tumour DNA content is less than 30 per cent10. FISH and aCGH have a 90 per cent concordance rate, with 85 per cent of discrepancies due to inadequate tumour tissue for aCGH11. FISH and aCGH can be used as alternative or complementary techniques, and an algorithm has been proposed for their use in atypical Spitz tumours8. The biggest limitation to routine application of FISH, aCGH and other genomic techniques for borderline melanocytic lesions is that there is a lack of robust evidence to support their cost, and to define the clinical implications of all the possible test results. For example, although atyp- ical spitzoid tumours with an isolated homozygous loss of © 2018 BJS Society Ltd www.bjs.co.uk BJS 2018; 105: e31–e47 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd Genomics and the surgical management of melanoma e33 a  Atypical Spitz tumour b  Histology of atypical Spitz tumour c  Pleomorphic melanocytes d  FISH study for CDKN2A Fig. 1 Use of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to assist in the diagnosis of a borderline melanocytic lesion. a Clinical appearance of an atypical Spitz tumour arising on the great toe of a 3-year-old boy. b–d Microscopic appearances of an atypical Spitz tumour with features suspicious for malignancy biopsied from the face of 2-year-old boy. This tumour was ulcerated and showed sheet-like growth to the deep dermis (b), and featured large pleomorphic melanocytes that did not mature with depth (c). FISH studies demonstrated a loss of region 9p21 (red probe) relative to the control probe on the centromere of chromosome 9 (aqua probe). d This pattern indicates homozygous loss of CDKN2A, a tumour suppressor gene, and is associated with a higher risk of malignant behaviour. On the basis of the histopathological features and the FISH findings, the patient received the final diagnosis of spitzoid melanoma. The tumour metastasized to a regional lymph node within 6 months of diagnosis 9p21 (CDKN2A tumour suppressor gene; Fig. 1d) have a high rate of distant metastasis (55 per cent) and death from melanoma (27 per cent), an isolated gain of 8q24 (MYC oncogene) is of uncertain clinical significance, due in part to the low prevalence in this tumour type12. This limita- tion applies particularly to next-generation sequencing, whereby the entire genome of a tumour can be sequenced to produce hundreds of gigabytes of data. Among all of this information, there are no doubt some features relevant to the clinical problem, such as the presence of a telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter mutation13. Thus, the role of molecular testing in melanoma manage- ment is destined to evolve over the coming years as further studies clarify the use of current and emerging techniques. What is likely to remain constant is that all molecular tests need to be performed by laboratories engaged in regular internal and external quality control activities, and all test results need to be interpreted in the context of the clinical and histological findings14. © 2018 BJS Society Ltd www.bjs.co.uk BJS 2018; 105: e31–e47 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd e34 P. M. Ferguson, G. V. Long, R. A. Scolyer and J. F. Thompson Prognostic biomarkers using gene expression profiles The single most powerful predictor of outcome in pri- mary melanoma is Breslow thickness: patients with a thin melanoma (1 mm or less) have a 95 per cent 5-year survival rate, whereas this falls to 35–50 per cent in those with a thick melanoma (greater than 4 mm). Nevertheless, owing to its higher incidence, more people die with thin than with thick melanomas (23 versus 14 per cent respectively)15,16. Therefore, a diagnostic test that could identify patients with a thin melanoma who are at risk of metastasis and death could be of significant clinical value for directing follow-up. The search for biomarkers in these patients has been limited by the poor preservation of clinical melanoma tissue in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks. MicroRNA (miRNA) is a short (22 nucleotides) single-stranded RNA molecule that negatively regu- lates gene expression and is well preserved in FFPE tissue17. MiRNA are attractive targets that show a melanoma-specific signature18 that can be of prognostic value, such as predicting the risk of SN involvment19–21. Assays using miRNA to assess risk of metastasis are cur- rently limited by small numbers, short clinical follow-up, and lack of significance versus histological parameters such as Breslow thickness in multivariable analysis22. Further- more, these tests should not be performed on partial biop- sies or re-excisions owing to the risk of unrepresentative sampling or artefacts due to wound healing respectively23. Genomic assessment of surgical margins The histological assessment of surgical margins can be complicated by an increase in melanocytes seen in chron- ically sun-damaged skin and overlying a surgical scar24,25. In acral melanomas, extensions of cytologically banal melanocytes have been shown to harbour the same cyclin D1 abnormalities as the adjacent melanoma cells26. These genetically altered cells extend from the invasive melanoma by up to 5 mm, but further validation is required to deter- mine whether this molecular margin correlates with risk of recurrence. Monitoring for disease recurrence Melanoma can recur even decades after removal of a pri- mary tumour. When melanoma does recur, it is found locally (20 per cent), in regional lymph nodes (50 per cent), or at distant sites (30 per cent)27. Although the time to first recurrence peaks at 12 months, subsequent metas- tases usually occur at progressively shorter intervals28. To monitor for recurrence in patients with early and advanced disease, the surgeon can incorporate clinical assessment, imaging and serological assays. There is no proven survival benefit for surveillance imaging in advanced melanoma, and this is reflected in wide variations in international guidelines29. Imaging surveillance protocols will no doubt evolve as further clinical trials refine the indications for, and sequence of, surgery and non-operative therapies for stage III and IV disease. Additionally, emerging data suggest that patients with advanced melanoma have improved responses to drug therapies and prolonged progression-free sur- vival (PFS) when there is a lower disease burden, fewer metastatic sites and smaller diameter metastases, suggest- ing that intense surveillance protocols for high-risk stage III melanoma may be important30,31. Genomic methods can detect melanoma progression when it is still below the detection thresholds of histological and radiological assess- ments. These techniques have varying levels of supporting evidence and clinical value, as presented below. Testing sentinel nodes for molecular evidence of metastasis Detection of melanocyte RNA in SNs by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) has shown conflicting impacts on survival in different studies32. A large recent trial33 showed that patients have signifi- cantly better 10-year disease-free and melanoma-specific survival rates if their nodes are positive by RT–PCR only, versus those with histological evidence of metastasis, and found no significant differences in survival compared with SN-negative patients. The presence of small capsular naevi in up to 20 per cent of inguinal and axillary nodes may par- tially explain why the molecular detection of melanocyte RNA in SNs has limited prognostic value, and is therefore not recommended to direct adjuvant therapy34,35. Circulating factors in patients with advanced disease The detection and monitoring of metastatic disease by analysis of circulating factors could potentially detect pre- clinical disease, reduce radiation exposure through fewer scans, and decrease the requirement for tissue biopsies. These factors include circulating proteins, tumour cells and nucleic acids. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), an enzyme involved in anaerobic glucose metabolism, is the earliest and best established circulating marker of disease burden, and is the only biomarker included in the eighth edition (2016) of the AJCC staging system for melanoma36. An increased level of LDH predicts a 50 per cent reduction in 1- and 2-year overall survival (OS) rates in patients with © 2018 BJS Society Ltd www.bjs.co.uk BJS 2018; 105: e31–e47 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd Genomics and the surgical management of melanoma e35 stage IV disease3. S100B, a melanocyte marker, may be a better marker of both stage III and stage IV disease than LDH, but is not widely available for clinical use37. Both LDH and S100B can show false positivity, particularly in the context of vascular events38. Although an estimated one million melanoma cells are shed into the circulation from every gram of primary tumour, only one to three are viable39. The detection of cir- culating melanoma cells (CMCs) is still limited by their low concentration, despite technological advances40. Further- more, CMCs are a prerequisite for, not proof of, metastatic disease, and they can show molecular characteristics that differ from those of the solid tumour from which they orig- inated (phenotypic drift)41. Advanced melanoma, with its high rate of cellular turnover, releases circulating cell-free nucleic acids that can be detected in plasma by PCR-based techniques. The presence of circulating messenger RNA (mRNA) encod- ing melanoma markers (such as tyrosinase and gp100) can predict disease progression, and may correlate with the stage of disease42. These findings are limited by a low sen- sitivity and no predictive value for OS35. Short fragments of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) have proved to be a more promising target that can be measured to assess disease burden, predict response to therapy, and monitor for disease resistance in advanced melanoma43. A patient’s burden of melanoma is associated with ctDNA levels, and changes in ctDNA can precede radiological progression of their disease, or a response to therapy44. In patients receiv- ing immunotherapy, ctDNA levels at baseline and early during treatment provide an accurate prediction of tumour response, PFS and OS45. Mutations that drive resistance to BRAF and/or MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase) inhibitors were detected in ctDNA preceding radiological evidence of disease progression in 43 per cent of patients46. These results are all encouraging; how- ever, prospective studies in larger cohorts of patients are required to validate the application of ctDNA to clinical decision-making in patients with advanced melanoma. The ability to detect and monitor melanoma through a peripheral blood sample would represent a significant advance in management. Although current technologies have not proved effective in early-stage disease, there is accumulating evidence of their clinical value in advanced melanoma, and much ongoing research in this promising area47. Genomic basis for advances in systemic therapy Melanoma has one of the highest mutation rates of all can- cers and, although most of these are passenger mutations of little significance, there are recurrent mutations in cell signalling pathways that have been shown to be key drivers of the pathogenesis of melanoma48,49. The devel- opment of therapies that target these pathways has been a significant advance, resulting in improved survival of patients with advanced disease. Another major advance in treating advanced melanoma has been realized in recent years through immunotherapy, the goal of which is to re-establish cytotoxic immune responses against the tumour, and to eliminate cancer cells. Surgeons are likely to have increasing exposure to patients with melanoma treated with these therapies for the foreseeable future, particularly in adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings. There- fore, an overview of the molecular mechanisms and clinical effectiveness of targeted and immune therapies is provided. Driver mutations in melanoma The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is responsible for cellular proliferation, differentiation and survival (Fig. 2a) and is activated abnormally in over 90 per cent of primary cutaneous melanomas50,51. Mutations in three genes that act within this pathway (BRAF, NRAS and NF1) occur in more than 75 per cent of cutaneous melanomas52,53. Most of these are point mutations that result in a single amino acid change in a critical region, enabling amplifiers of the pathway to remain constitutively activated (BRAF, NRAS) or causing loss of a normal func- tion in dampening the pathway (NF1). Such mutations are termed driver mutations because they are early neoplastic events, are almost always mutually exclusive, and activate molecular pathways that can be targeted to control tumour growth54,55. BRAF mutations are the most common (Fig. 2b), present in 30–50 per cent of cutaneous melanomas, followed by NRAS (25 per cent) and NF1 (less than 10 per cent) mutations56. All three strongly associate with genetic sig- natures of an ultraviolet (UV) radiation effect, whereas less than 30 per cent of melanomas lacking any of these mutations (triple wild-type) show UV signatures. In con- trast, UV signatures are rare in melanomas from acral and mucosal sites, which instead show higher rates of copy number changes, complex structural rearrangements and more frequent abnormalities in the KIT oncogene53. Targeted therapies The discovery of abnormally activated cellular path- ways in melanoma provided a therapeutic opportunity to target these specific pathways and the mutated onco- genes involved.

The inhibitory activity of the tumour suppressor p16 on the MAP kinase pathway is often lost in melanoma through mutation. Targeted inhibitors of mutant BRAF and wild-type MEK block this pathway to inhibit proliferation and increase apoptosis of tumour cells.

Improved OS with targeted ther- apies (BRAF and MEK inhibitors) has so far been limited to patients with advanced V600 BRAF-mutant melanoma, although advanced melanomas driven by mutations in other genes have also shown responses to targeted thera- pies. Patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma treated with © 2018 BJS Society Ltd www.bjs.co.uk BJS 2018; 105: e31–e47 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd Genomics and the surgical management of melanoma e37 a MEK inhibitor (binimetinib) had a modest improvement in PFS versus dacarbazine chemotherapy (median 2⋅8 versus 1⋅5 months respectively; hazard ratio (HR) 0⋅62, P < 0⋅001)57, and a phase I study58 of a MEK inhibitor combined with a CDK4/6 inhibitor showed a potentially higher response rate. KIT inhibitors (imatinib and nilo- tinib) can induce short-lived responses in KIT-mutant melanomas, the majority of which originated on acral or mucosal sites59,60. The BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) vemurafenib and dabrafenib are small-molecule kinase inhibitors that selectively inhibit the V600 BRAF-mutant protein (Fig. 2b). Phase III trials of BRAFi monotherapy ver- sus dacarbazine chemotherapy in patients with V600 BRAF-mutant advanced melanoma demonstrated a signif- icantly improved response, PFS and OS compared with dacarbazine chemotherapy (OS: HR 0⋅37, 95 per cent c.i. 0⋅26 to 0⋅55, P < 0⋅001)61–63. Addition of a MEK inhibitor to the BRAFi (vemurafenib plus cobimetinib or dabrafenib plus trametinib) produced further significant improvements in response, PFS and OS (OS: HR 0⋅67, 0⋅53 to 0⋅84, P < 0⋅001) compared with BRAFi monother- apy in phase III trials. This combination is currently the standard targeted therapy for V600 BRAF-mutant advanced melanoma (Fig. 2b)64,65. In a pooled analysis of dabrafenib combined with trametinib across two ran- domized trials, the 1- and 3-year PFS rates were 48 and 23 per cent, and the 1- and 3-year OS rates were 74 and 44 per cent, respectively, suggesting that, although resistance may develop, there is a subset of patients with long-term control of advanced melanoma, particularly those with a normal baseline LDH or fewer than three organs involved with metastases, or those who have had a complete response66,67. When administered to patients without a BRAF mutation, these therapies were ineffective and BRAFi monotherapy was potentially harmful68,69, highlighting the importance of accurate testing for BRAF mutations64,70,71. Targeted therapy can produce a rapid and dramatic clin- ical response, whereas its limitations are that it can be given only to the subset of patients shown to have a V600 BRAF-mutant melanoma by tissue-based molecular testing. Resistance develops within 1 year in the majority of patients treated by BRAF inhibitor monotherapy72. Therapies targeting other proteins such as vascular endothelial growth factor, cyclin-dependent kinases or members of the phosphoinositol kinase pathway are at various stages of clinical development and are likely to expand the number of clinically effective molecular tar- geted therapies, as well as the number of patients eligible to receive them, over the coming years73–75. Immunotherapy Melanoma is an immunogenic tumour, well documented by instances of spontaneous regression of both primary and metastatic tumours associated histologically with immune infiltrates76,77. Four different modes of immunotherapy have been evaluated in clinical trials: vaccines, T cells, oncolytic viruses and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Only immune checkpoint inhibitors have been shown to improve response, PFS and OS rates compared with standard treat- ment in advanced melanoma1. Vaccines Vaccine-based therapies involve the administration of tumour antigens in various forms including peptides, heatshock proteins, DNA and whole cells. These can be administered with adjuvants and/or loaded on to autolo- gous dendritic cells harvested from a patient’s peripheral blood78–83. Melanoma vaccines have demonstrated proof of principle with good effect in animal models, but have thus far met with limited success in clinical studies, with responses seen in less than 10 per cent of patients84,85. T cells Adoptive T cell therapy involves extraction and ex vivo expansion of tumour-infiltrating or circulating lympho- cytes, which can then be transduced genetically to express T cell receptors specific for tumour antigens. An additional advantage is obtained by transducing a chimeric antigen receptor on to the surface of T cells (CAR T cells). A chimeric receptor contains a signalling domain to activate the T cell without requiring the melanoma cells to express antigens on major histocompatibility complex molecules86, which are often downregulated on the surface of cancer cells as an immune escape mechanism87. Durable com- plete responses have been achieved in a minority of patients with melanoma using adoptive T cell therapy88, whereas CAR T cell therapy for melanoma is still being assessed in phase I/II trials (NCT01218867, NCT02107963, NCT02830724, NCT03060356). Although T cell thera- pies show promise, they remain to be validated in phase III trials, and they require highly specialized expertise and laboratory infrastructure, which restricts their application to large centres89. Oncolytic viruses Another recent therapeutic development in melanoma is the application of oncolytic viruses. These live, attenu- ated viruses produce an antitumour effect by infecting tumour cells, producing tumour cell lysis, with release of tumour antigens, and thereby promoting systemic immu- nity against those antigens.

Thompson unresectable advanced melanoma showed improvement in the rate of durable responses, but not OS, in patients whose melanomas were injected with an oncolytic virus versus granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (for durable response: odds ratio 8⋅9, 95 per cent c.i. 2⋅7 to 29⋅2, P < 0⋅01). The viral agent employed in this trial, talimogene laherperepvec (T-VEC), was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2015 for treatment of melanoma in skin and lymph nodes by direct injection. The limitations of this type of therapy include the need for direct administration into tumour sites and the low response rate (26 per cent); the latter problem is being addressed by studies combining oncolytic viral therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors91. Immune checkpoint inhibitors Of the new systemic therapies for melanoma, immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy has produced the greatest clinical impact. Monoclonal antibodies directed against cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein (CTLA) 4 (ipilimumab) and programmed cell death protein (PD) 1 (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) block the downreg- ulation of T cell responses, which in turn can boost cytotoxic immune responses directed against melanoma (Fig. 3). Ipilimumab was the first drug shown to produce a survival benefit in a phase III study in melanoma92, with a recent meta-analysis67 showing long-term survival reaching a plateau of 20 per cent at 3 years, and extending to 10 years for some patients with advanced melanoma. In a phase III study93 comparing anti-PD-1 monother- apy (pembrolizumab) with ipilimumab, pembrolizumab showed superior OS (12-month OS rate 74 versus 58 per cent respectively; HR 0⋅63, 95 per cent c.i. 0⋅47 to 0⋅83, P < 0⋅001) with fewer adverse effects. It is known from animal studies that these agents can act synergistically, and there are some clinical trial data to support this in humans94,95. An RCT (Checkmate 067)96 for patients with untreated advanced melanoma (unresectable stage III or any stage IV disease) showed improved OS with nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus ipilimumab (36-month OS rate 58 versus 34 per cent respectively; HR 0⋅55, 0⋅45 to 0⋅69, P < 0⋅001) and with nivolumab versus ipilimumab (HR 0⋅65, 0⋅53 to 0⋅80, P < 0⋅001). Numerically higher rates of PFS and OS with the combination therapy over nivolumab monotherapy were seen in the majority of clinically relevant subgroups; however, the combination group had not reached median OS, and the difference in OS with nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus nivolumab was not significant at 3 years (HR 0⋅85, 0⋅68 to 1⋅07). Conclusive evidence of whether the combination of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapies can improve survival over monotherapy, and in which subgroups the combination therapy produces the greatest advantages, will have to await further follow-up from this trial and others that are adequately powered to answer this question. In addition to CTLA-4 and PD-1, T lymphocytes express other receptor molecules that impact the activation of an antitumour response. In preclinical studies, antibodies directed against glucocorticoid-induced tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor (GITR) have shown effect against melanoma through inhibiting immunosuppressive regula- tory T cells, while activating cytotoxic cluster of differ- entiation (CD) 8+ T effector cells97. Anti-GITR ther- apy is currently being assessed in phase I and II clini- cal trials as a monotherapy, or in combination with other immunotherapeutic agents98. Other immune checkpoint agonists and inhibitors are in development, including anti- bodies directed at T cell molecules: lymphocyte acti- vation gene (LAG) 3, TIGIT (T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains), TIM-3 (T cell Ig- and mucin-domain-containing molecule 3), CD137 (4-1BB), CD134 (OX40) and CD27. These will be trialled as monotherapy or, more commonly, in combination phase I/II studies with PD-1 pathway inhibitors99. As these treatments involve systemic blockade of a physiological pathway that maintains self-tolerance, it is perhaps not surprising that the side-effect profile is dominated by autoimmune phenomena including colitis, dermatitis, sarcoidosis-like syndrome, hepatitis and endocrinopathies100–104. These side-effects led to discontinuation of therapy in 36 per cent of patients receiving combination anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 therapy94. Despite treatment cessation, patients who ini- tially respond may still develop a durable response105. Immune checkpoint inhibitors currently offer the best hope of long-term disease control, with follow-up data from an early nivolumab study showing a 34 per cent OS rate at 5 years for patients with advanced melanoma105,106. The most significant limitation to checkpoint inhibitors is that there are currently no reliable biomarkers to separate patients who will respond from the 40–50 per cent of patients in whom no benefits are achieved95,107. Genomic testing to guide treatment of metastatic disease To determine a patient’s eligibility for targeted therapy, adequate tissue must be obtained for molecular testing. At present, targeted therapies are available for patients with BRAF, NRAS and KIT mutations, and this list is likely to expand in the near future. The ideal sample for molecular testing is tissue from the most recent metastasis; © 2018 BJS Society Ltd www.bjs.co.uk BJS 2018; 105: e31–e47 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd Genomics and the surgical management of melanoma e39 Antigen-presenting cell Effector T lymphocyte Immunosuppression Melanoma cell Melanoma cell CTLA-4 CD86 PD-L1 PD-L1 PD-L1 MHC I MHC II PD-1 PD-1 PD-1 TCR TCR PD-L1 MHC I PD-1 TCR CD28 CTLA-4 PD-L1 PD-1 TCR CD28 CD86 CD86 PD-L1 MHC II PD-1 CD86 Apoptosis versus Activation Proliferation Survival Activation Anti-CTLA-4 Anti-PD-1 Proliferation Survival Antitumour activity b Action of immune checkpoint inhibitor drugs a Activation and inhibition of antitumour immunity Fig. 3 Antitumour immunity and the action of immune checkpoint inhibitors. a For activation of antitumour activity, effector T cells require tumour antigen to be presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules in the context of co-stimulatory molecules (e.g. cluster of differentiation (CD) 86). The melanoma microenvironment increases the expression of programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1) on tumour cells and antigen-presenting cells, and increases T-cell cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein (CTLA) 4 expression, all of which inhibit activation of T cells, and promote their apoptosis. b Immune checkpoint inhibitor drugs can restore antitumour activity by blocking CTLA-4 and/or PD-L1.

Scolyer and J. F. Thompson however, other sources of melanoma tissue from the patient can suffice as there is a greater than 90 per cent rate of concordance between primary and metastatic tissue, and among multiple metastases108,109. Molecular testing can be performed on archival tumour samples, including cell blocks prepared from fine-needle aspirates, where adequate tumour tissue is available110. Most molecular tests require the sample to contain at least 5 per cent viable melanoma cells. Samples that fail are often those with large areas of tumour necrosis, those with abundant contaminating lymphocytes (such as fine-needle aspirates from lymph nodes) and bony samples that have under- gone acid decalcification (which degrades DNA). These problems can often be avoided by communication with the receiving laboratory to indicate that molecular testing may be required. Molecular testing is required to guide targeted therapy Immunohistochemistry can serve as a quick screen, with excellent sensitivity for the BRAF V600E mutation111. If immunohistochemistry is negative, alternative forms of testing are required to screen for other treatable muta- tions in BRAF (such as V600K, present in 10–20 per cent of the BRAF-mutant melanoma population) and other genes56,112,113. Assays using multiplex PCR can amplify multiple targets in one test. Analysis of the amplified nucleic acids is then performed using techniques such as mass spectrometry114. This type of test has the advan- tage of being able to detect hundreds of point mutations across multiple genes that are of known significance in cancer. Next-generation sequencing, where multiple genes are sequenced in parallel, is currently employed only in research settings in melanoma. Although this technology can provide detailed characterization of melanomas53, the additional information it supplies is of limited clinical value for the significant increase in cost, complexity and specialist expertise required. Molecular testing is currently of limited use for directing immune therapy Currently there are no robust tissue predictors of response to systemic immune therapies. Although the presence of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and/or the expression of PD-1 and/or programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1) identified by immunohistochemistry is associ- ated with response and survival in patients with advanced melanoma treated with anti-PD-1-based therapies, the sensitivity and specificity are poor115–118. Interestingly, a lack of PD-L1 expression on melanoma cells is associated with a greater benefit from ipilimumab plus nivolumab compared with nivolumab alone94. Given the toxicity of the combination, PD-L1 expression may be useful to select patients who are borderline in their ability to tolerate the potential side-effects of combined immunotherapy. Measuring responses to immunotherapy Interpreting a patient’s response to immunotherapy is complicated by the phenomenon of pseudoprogression, where inflammation can cause tumours to enlarge initially or increase in number on CT, with enhanced uptake on fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET119. This is in contrast to targeted therapies, where a rapid reduction in tumour burden and FDG uptake on PET/CT is generally seen in patients who respond120. The concept of pseudopro- gression was well demonstrated in a pooled analysis of phase III trials, in which 28 per cent of patients treated with anti-PD-1 therapy (nivolumab) had a target lesion reduction greater than 30 per cent after progression com- pared with baseline, with no new or unexpected adverse events121. New immune-related response criteria were developed to address pseudoprogression and delayed responses to immunotherapy. For progressive disease, these criteria require there to be at least a 25 per cent increase in tumour burden compared with nadir on two consecutive observations at least 4 weeks apart122. Adjuvant and neoadjuvant strategies Role of surgery As treatment options for advanced melanoma increase, so does the complexity of clinical decision-making. Compared with systemic therapies, surgery offers benefits that are unique and complementary. Surgery is a good treatment option for patients with low-volume metastatic disease, and remains valuable to remove residual disease after targeted and immune therapies. Surgery can clear large metastatic tumours and is generally better tolerated than systemic therapies123. There is increasing evidence that surgery can reduce melanoma-induced immunosuppression, providing potential synergy with systemic immunotherapies124. This provides some of the rationale behind current prospective clinical trials of neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatments for stage III and IV melanoma. Until the results of these and further trials are published with adequate follow-up, select- ing patients for surgical resection of metastatic melanoma needs to be considered individually, in the context of a multidisciplinary team discussion. © 2018 BJS Society Ltd www.bjs.co.uk BJS 2018; 105: e31–e47 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd Genomics and the surgical management of melanoma e41 Adjuvant therapy An RCT125 has shown that adjuvant ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) following resection of stage III disease improves PFS and OS rates at 5 years versus placebo (OS: 65 versus 54 per cent respectively; HR 0⋅72, 95 per cent c.i. 0⋅58 to 0⋅88, P = 0⋅001). This benefit in survival came at a cost: grade 3–4 immune-related adverse events occurred in 42 per cent of patients treated with ipilimumab, with several deaths, compared with 3 per cent in the placebo arm. Uncertainty remains over which patients should receive ipilimumab for resected stage III disease, and at what dose and duration of treatment126. Nivolumab (anti-PD-1) was shown to be superior to ipilimumab in an RCT127 for resected stage III and IV dis- ease. At a minimum follow-up of 18 months, the 12-month rate of recurrence-free survival was 70⋅5 per cent in the nivolumab group and 60⋅8 per cent in the ipilimumab group (HR for relapse or death 0⋅65, 95 per cent c.i. 0⋅51 to 0⋅83; P < 0⋅001). Treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events were reported in 14⋅4 per cent of patients in the nivolumab group and in 45⋅9 per cent of those in the ipilimumab group. Treatment was discontinued because of any adverse event in 9⋅7 and 42⋅6 per cent of patients respectively. Two deaths (0⋅4 per cent) related to toxic effects were reported in the ipilimumab group. This study established nivolumab as more effective and considerably less toxic than ipilimumab in the adjuvant setting. No placebo group was included, but, consider- ing the proven survival advantage with ipilimumab over placebo, it can be inferred that adjuvant nivolumab would be significantly superior to no treatment125. Longer follow-up is required to assess the OS in this trial population. Targeted therapy has also shown great promise as adju- vant therapy. Patients with BRAF-mutant resected stage III melanoma received either combination BRAF plus MEK inhibitor therapy (dabrafenib and trametinib) or placebo for 12 months128. At a median follow-up of 2⋅8 years, the estimated 3-year rate of relapse-free survival was 58 per cent in the combination group and 39 per cent in the placebo group (HR for relapse or death 0⋅47, 95 per cent c.i. 0⋅39 to 0⋅58; P < 0⋅001). The 3-year OS rate was 86 per cent in the combination group and 77 per cent in the placebo group (HR 0⋅57, 0⋅42 to 0⋅79; P < 0⋅001). Grade 3–4 side-effects were experienced by 41 per cent in the combination group, and one death (0⋅2 per cent) was reported. It is worth noting that all three of the above trials required participants to have completion lymph node dissections within 12 weeks before randomization. The second Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial33 recently showed that patients with stage III melanoma with microscopic nodal disease gained no survival advan- tage with completion lymphadenectomy compared with regular ultrasound surveillance after a positive SN biopsy. This seminal study is likely to change surgical practice and hence how these adjuvant trial results are applied to future patients. Neoadjuvant therapy Neoadjuvant therapy holds promise for reducing sur- gical morbidity, whilst allowing postoperative adjuvant therapy to be tailored for each patient based on their neoadjuvant response. Early results from phase II neoad- juvant therapy trials show promise for both targeted and immune therapy. For bulky and/or unresectable stage III disease, neoadjuvant BRAF plus MEK inhibitor ther- apy can improve relapse-free survival over surgery alone and induce a complete pathological response in 50–58 per cent of patients before surgery129–131. A combina- tion of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 therapy produced a response rate of 80 per cent in a neoadjuvant set- ting, with subsequent surgery confirming a complete or near-complete response (micrometases only) in seven of ten patients132. Interestingly, there was a higher rate of drug-related adverse events compared with that in patients with stage IV disease, suggesting that advanced melanoma produces immune suppression that can reduce both the efficacy and the toxicity of immunotherapy. An ongoing international trial is examining the efficacy and toxicity of 6 weeks of neoadjuvant anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 therapy in three different dosing strategies (NCT02437279). Remaining challenges Advances in genomics have brought rapid changes in the clinical management of advanced melanoma, bringing new therapies, diagnostic tests and clinical considerations. Arguably, the biggest impact on surgical decision-making is the complex and still evolving relationship between surgery, systemic therapy and radiotherapy. Clinical tri- als are currently assessing the benefits of adjuvant and neoadjuvant immunotherapy, to determine whether resid- ual disease is more immunogenic or immunosuppressive, and the optimal sequence of treatment modalities for a given patient and their disease burden. Radiotherapy may have an increasing role to play, with its potential to improve responses to immunotherapy133. The role of molecular testing at each phase of melanoma management is summarized in Table 1.

Molecular testing of metastatic melanoma for driver mutations in oncogenes such as BRAF and NRAS is now standard practice for all patients with metastatic disease. Molecular assays of histologically ambiguous primary tumours are increasingly applied in special contexts, such as atypical Spitz tumours in chil- dren and young adults. Areas that show an increasing evidence base but lack confirmation in large prospective trials include the use of circulating DNA and the testing of metastatic tissue for factors to predict responses to immunotherapy. Recent advances highlight the challenges that remain. Melanoma has a natural behaviour and response to ther- apy that differs from that of other tumour types and can be difficult to predict with current clinicopathological, radi- ological and genomic tools. Important questions remain: which patients with early-stage disease will benefit from adjuvant therapy; which patients with metastatic disease will respond to immunotherapy; which metastatic lesions should be resected and when should systemic therapy be given; and, most importantly, how can durable response rates in advanced disease be improved using combinations of surgery, radiotherapy and systemic therapy? As these challenges are being addressed in clinical tri- als, the monitoring and management of patients with metastatic melanoma is in a complex and rapidly evolv- ing phase. Multidisciplinary communication is clearly the key to optimal management of each patient, with surgery remaining an important element of that multidisciplinary decision-making process.
