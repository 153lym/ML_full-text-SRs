We aimed to estimate the effect of invasive versus non-invasive management within 3 days of peak troponin  concentration on the survival of patients aged 80 years or older with NSTEMI. Methods Routine clinical data for this study were obtained from five collaborating hospitals hosting NIHR  Biomedical Research Centres in the UK (all tertiary centres with emergency departments). Eligible patients  were 80 years old or older when they underwent troponin measurements and were diagnosed with NSTEMI  between 2010 (2008 for University College Hospital) and 2017. Propensity scores (patients’ estimated probability of  receiving invasive management) based on pretreatment variables were derived using logistic regression; patients  with high probabilities of non-invasive or invasive management were excluded. Patients who died within 3 days of  peak troponin concentration without receiving invasive management were assigned to the invasive or non-invasive  management groups based on their propensity scores, to mitigate immortal time bias. We estimated mortality  hazard ratios comparing invasive with non-invasive management, and compared the rate of hospital admissions for  heart failure. Findings Of the 1976 patients with NSTEMI, 101 died within 3 days of their peak troponin concentration and 375 were  excluded because of extreme propensity scores. The remaining 1500 patients had a median age of 86 (IQR 82–89) years  of whom (845 [56%] received non-invasive management. During median follow-up of 3·0 (IQR 1·2–4·8) years,  613 (41%) patients died. The adjusted cumulative 5-year mortality was 36% in the invasive management group and  55% in the non-invasive management group (adjusted hazard ratio 0·68, 95% CI 0·55–0·84). Invasive management  was associated with lower incidence of hospital admissions for heart failure (adjusted rate ratio compared with  non-invasive management 0·67, 95% CI 0·48–0·93). Interpretation The survival advantage of invasive compared with non-invasive management appears to extend to  patients with NSTEMI who are aged 80 years or older.

Introduction Most patients with a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction  (NSTEMI) are aged 70 years or older.1 The proportion of  the global population aged 80 years or older is projected  to triple over the next 20 years.2 Increasing age is a key  predictor of adverse events in patients with coronary artery  disease: older patients presenting with an acute coronary  syndrome are at higher risk of short-term and long- term adverse out comes compared with younger patients.3,4  However, the rate of invasive coronary angiography  declines with age. Only 38% of patients with NSTEMI who  are aged 81 years or older receive a coronary angiogram,  compared with 78% of those aged 60 years or younger.5 Large randomised trials showed a long-term survival  advantage for invasive management compared with  non-invasive management of NSTEMI, but the mean  age of participants was 66 years. Few patients in their  80s were enrolled into these studies and the survival  benefit cannot be assumed to translate to these patients.6  Because of the perceived higher risks of invasive  procedures, many physicians manage only a minority of  older patients with NSTEMI invasively.

Although these studies attempted  to control for this confounding by indication, their results  might have been affected by immortal time bias10,11 because  patients who died early in the course of their presentation— before invasive therapy could be considered or arranged— were assigned to the non-invasive group. Questions about comparative effectiveness should  ideally be answered using randomised trials.12 The  SENIOR-RITA trial13 aims to determine whether an  invasive compared with a non-invasive management  strategy reduces time to cardiovascular death or non-fatal  myocardial infarction in patients aged 75 years or older  with NSTEMI. However, the final completion date is not  expected until 2029.13 Estimates of comparative effectiveness from observa- tional databases might be improved through specification  of the hypothetical (target) randomised trial, the results  of which would answer the specific clinical question of  interest.14 We estimated the effect of invasive manage- ment compared with non-invasive management on  survival in patients aged 80 years or older with NSTEMI  using multicentre routinely collected clinical data  (SENIOR-NSTEMI study), using methods that help to  minimise bias in analyses of observational data through  consideration of the target trial. Methods Study design and participants The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)  Health Informatics Collaborative was established to  facilitate the sharing and routine reuse of clinical data  for trans lational research.15,16 Data for this study were  obtained from five collaborating hospitals hosting  NIHR Biomedical Research Centres (Imperial College  Healthcare, London; University College Hospital,  London; Oxford University Hospitals, Oxford; King’s  College Hospital, London; and Guys & St Thomas’  Research in context Evidence before this study Electronic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane  Central Register of Controlled Trials were done for articles in  English published from inception of these databases to  Jan 20, 2019. Studies with the following characteristics were  identified: (1) randomised trials or observational studies,  either restricted to populations aged 75 years or older reporting  outcomes for this patient subgroup; (2) patients presenting  with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI);  and (3) comparison of invasive management (coronary  angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention or  coronary artery bypass grafting during index admission) with  non-invasive management during the index hospital  admission. Only 38% of patients with NSTEMI aged 81 years or  older receive a coronary angiogram, compared with 78% of  those aged 60 years or younger. In routine care, frail patients  with multiple comorbidities are less likely to be treated  invasively. Large randomised trials have shown a long-term  survival advantage for invasive compared with non-invasive  management of NSTEMI, but the mean age of these  participants was 66 years. Few patients aged 80 years or older  were enrolled into these studies and as a result the survival  benefit cannot be assumed to translate to older patients.  Because the evidence to support invasive management is not  conclusive, many physicians treat older patients with NSTEMI  symptomatically, offering invasive management only to  selected patients, such as those with ongoing chest pain. The European Society of Cardiology and American Heart  Association guidelines suggest that older patients with NSTEMI  should be considered for invasive management with coronary  angiography and revascularisation, but there is conflicting  evidence for this recommendation. Only two small randomised  trials and two post-hoc subgroup analyses of larger randomised  trials have evaluated invasive versus non-invasive management  for NSTEMI in older patients: a meta-analysis that pooled data  from these trials did not find clear evidence that invasive therapy  reduced long-term mortality (odds ratio 0·84, 95% CI 0·66–1·06). Although registry studies have attempted to address whether  the benefit of invasive management extends to older  patients,  their results might have been affected by immortal time bias,  because patients who died early in the course of their  presentation, before invasive therapy could be considered or  arranged, were assigned to the non-invasive group. Added value of this study To our knowledge this is the first study to estimate the effect of  invasive compared with non-invasive management of NSTEMI  on the survival of patients aged 80 years or older using  multicentre, routine clinical data and methods that help to  minimise bias in analyses of observational data by considering  the target trial that would answer the clinical question. This study  provides evidence that the survival advantage from invasive  management might extend to patients aged 80 years or older  with NSTEMI (adjusted hazard ratio 0·68, 95% CI 0·55–0·84). Implications of all the available evidence This study strengthens the evidence for an invasive approach to  management of patients aged 80 years or older with NSTEMI.  Ideally, clinical decision making should be driven by findings  from randomised trials. In the absence of randomised trial data,  clinical decisions need to be made on the basis of the best  available evidence. An invasive approach might be the better  management strategy in patients who could be managed  either invasively or non-invasively.

We defined the target trial as comparing patients  who had invasive management for NSTEMI (defined  as coronary angiography with or without subsequent  revascularisation within 3 days of peak troponin concen- tration) with patients who did not receive such invasive  management. We followed all included patients from the  time of their peak troponin concentration until death or  censoring in April, 2017. Eligible patients were 80 years old or older when they  underwent troponin measurements and were diagnosed  with NSTEMI between 2010 (2008 for University College  Hospital) and 2017. Only the first episode of hospital care  with troponin measure ments was eligible. Classification  of NSTEMI was made on the basis of the assigned  International Statistical Classification of Diseases and  Related Health Problems discharge codes (I21.4; acute  subendocardial myocardial infarction).17 Patients with a  concurrent primary diagnosis of an acute illness associated  with possible oxygen supply-and-demand mismatch were  excluded. We used the target trial to minimise bias by starting  follow up at the time of peak troponin; ensuring that early  deaths did not influence the definition of the intervention  group, to avoid immortal time bias; excluding patients  Figure 1: Study profile ACS=acute coronary syndrome.

Invasive management defined as angiography with or without revascularisation within  3 days of peak troponin concentration. *57 of the 77 deaths in patients not invasively managed within 3 days of the peak troponin concentration had eligible propensity  scores and were assigned to treatment groups using multiple imputation.

This study was approved by  the London-South East Research Ethics Committee  (REC reference: 16/HRA/3327). Outcomes The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. The  secondary outcome was the number of hospital admis- sions for heart failure during follow-up. In post-hoc  analyses we examined new hospital admissions for  bleeding, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, and further  invasive management. Bleeding was defined as minor or  major bleeding. Vital status was ascertained using  the national Patient Demographic Service, which  incorporates national death registry information and  local notifications. We could only ascertain heart failure  admission using electronic health record data in the  hospital where their initial NSTEMI diagnosis was  made. Statistical analysis In a randomised trial, follow-up starts at the time that  treatment strategies are assigned. In the absence of such  assignment, follow-up in patients who do not undergo  invasive management is consistent with both treatment  strategies for the first 3 days. Classification of patients  who die within 3 days of peak troponin concentration  without invasive management to the comparison group  can cause an immortal time bias because some patients  could have had invasive management had they not  died.10,11 To limit such bias, patients who died within  3 days of peak troponin concentration were excluded  from the initial modelling steps, then included separately. Propensity scores (patients’ estimated probability of  receiving invasive management) were derived using  logistic regression, for patients who did not die within  3 days of peak troponin concentration. The final propen- sity score model was based on backwards stepwise  selection, with a p value threshold of 0·2. We considered  the following pretreatment variable groups: patient  demographics, blood test results, cardiovascular risk  factors, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, respiratory  disease, neurological disease, psychiatric disease, other  comorbidities, and markers of frailty. The Comorbidity  Domain of the Frailty Index was calculated as a score  ranging between 0 and 1.18 All the variables considered  and those selected into the propensity score model are  listed in the appendix (pp 9–10). Non-linear relationships  were modelled using smoothing splines. Analyses used  the first mea surement of each haematological and  biochemical blood test during the hospital care episode,  except for troponin concentration for which the peak  measurement was used. We examined the number of patients and deaths in each  treatment group, within strata defined by propensity score  quantiles. Participants in a randomised trial must be  eligible to receive any of the interventions being compared.  Therefore, patients in a stratum for which there were few  patients or deaths in either group were excluded, to make  it more likely that analyses were restricted to patients  eligible to receive either treatment strategy. In such  patients, inverse probability of treatment weights were  defined as 1/propensity score in patients who received  invasive management and as 1/(1–pro pensity score) in  patients who received non-invasive management. We used Kaplan-Meier plots to display the cumulative  risk of mortality and hospital admission for heart failure  over time in each treatment group. The plots were  weighted for inverse probability of treatment to estimate  Figure 2: Combined histogram and probability density function of the propensity score for 1875 patients  with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction in patients aged 80 years or older according to invasive or  non-invasive management strategy Invasive management defined as angiography with or without revascularisation within 3 days of peak troponin  concentration.

We used Cox models (stratified by centre) to estimate  mortality hazard ratios (HR) comparing invasive man- agement with non-invasive management in patients  who did not die within 3 days of their peak troponin  concentra tion and who were in the eligible propensity  score strata. Two approaches were used to control  confounding: multi variable adjustment (including the  propensity score modelled using a restricted cubic  spline) and inverse probability of treatment weighting.  The variables adjusted for were chosen using backwards  stepwise selection, with a p value threshold of 0·2, and  treatment group was included in all models. The same  variables were considered for inclusion in the Cox  models as for the propensity score model (appendix  pp 9–10). We then included patients in eligible  propensity score strata who died within 3 days of their  peak troponin concentration. Those who had received  invasive inter vention were classified in the invasive  management group: the others (who might have  received invasive intervention had they not died) were  randomly assigned to the invasive or non-invasive  management group on the basis of their propensity  scores. We generated 20 datasets, estimated mortality  HRs in each, then pooled the results using Rubin’s  rules to estimate the overall HR. The pretreatment  variables included in these Cox model analyses are  listed in the appendix (pp 9–10). In sensitivity analyses, we quantified the potential for  unmeasured confounding to explain the effect of invasive  management on estimated mortality hazard ratios by  calculating the E value.19 We investigated the effect of  assigning all patients who died within 3 days of their  peak troponin concentration to one or the other treatment  group and of reducing the number of eligible propensity  score strata. Changes in the HR with age were investi- gated using cubic splines. The number of hospital  admissions relating to heart failure in the invasive  management and non-invasive management groups  were compared using negative binomial regression  adjusted by centre. The pretreatment variables included  were selected using backwards stepwise selection, with  a p value threshold of 0·2, and are listed in the appendix  (pp 9–10). Statistical analyses used R (version 3.5.0) and Stata  (version 16.0). The data acquisition plan is in the appendix  (pp 19–23). The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  NCT03507309.

Results Of the 61 342 patients aged 80 years or older who  had troponin measured in the study period Jan, 2010  (Jan, 2008 for University College Hospital, London, UK)  to April, 2017, 2788 (4·5%) had a diagnosis of NSTEMI.  116 (4·2%) patients were excluded because of missing  data in one or more variables and 696 (25%) had a con- current primary diag nosis with an acute illness (appendix  p 11). Of the 1976 patients included, 961 (49%) underwent  invasive management during their index admission of  whom 860 (89%) had invasive management during the  first 3 days after peak troponin concentration (appendix  p 3). There were 890 (45%) deaths in the 1976 patients  included, of which 101 were within the first 3 days after  peak troponin concentration. These 101 patients were  excluded from the next stage of the analyses (figure 1).  The characteristics of these patients are shown in the  appendix (pp 12–13). Characteristics of the patients that were associated  with receiving invasive man agement are shown in  the appendix (pp 4–5, 14–15). The propensity score  distributions for patients treated invasively and non- invasively are shown in figure 2. The proportion of  patients who died during follow-up in each group,  according to propensity score quantiles, are shown in  table 1. In both treatment groups, the proportion who  died was higher in patients with lower propensity scores  (those most likely to be non-invasively managed). Below  the tenth percentile (propensity score=0·0178) none of  the 188 patients were invasively managed and above the  90th percentile (propensity score=0·9292) only six (3%)  of 187 patients were non-invasively managed.

Revas cularisation was done in  486 (74%) of 655 patients undergoing invasive manage- ment. The strongest predictors of invasive management  were interhospital transfer (odds ratio [OR] 3·19, 95% CI  2·08–4·89) and family history of ischaemic heart disease  (2·84, 2·01–3·99), whereas interstitial lung disease  (0·22, 0·09–0·58) and indicators of frailty were strong  predictors of non-invasive management (table 2). During median 3·0 (IQR 1·2–4·8) years follow-up  there were 613 (41%) deaths. At 5 years, Kaplan-Meier  estimates of cumulative mortality from 3 days after peak  troponin concentration were 31% (168 events) in the  invasive management group and 61% (413 events) in the  non-invasive group (appendix p 6).

Table 2: Characteristics of participants who survived for at least 3 days after peak troponin concentration according to invasive or non-invasive  management strategy Articles 630  www.thelancet.com   Vol 396   August 29, 2020 estimated 5-year cumulative mortality of 36% if all these  patients received invasive intervention, compared with  55% if all received non-invasive intervention (figure 3A). The crude mortality HR comparing invasive with non- invasive management from 3 days after peak troponin  concentration was 0·38 (95% CI 0·32–0·46), attenuated  to 0·56 (0·45–0·70) after multivariable adjustment  for clinical characteristics and propensity score. The  mortal ity HR was further attenuated (0·66, 0·49–0·88]  following inverse probability of treatment weighting  (table 3). The propensity score distributions for the 101 patients  who died within 3 days of their peak troponin concen- tration are shown in the appendix (p 7). 77 (76%) patients  received non-invasive management and 78 patients had  a propensity score between the 10th and 89th percen- tiles. When these patients were assigned to treatment  groups based on their propensity score using multiple  imputation (primary analysis), the mortality HR was  0·68 (95% CI 0·55–0·84). The E value for unmeasured  confounding was 1·94. The adjusted HRs were 1·05  (0·86–1·27) after assigning all patients who died within  3 days of their peak troponin concentration to the  invasive group and 0·50 (0·40–0·61) after assigning  them to the non-invasive group (table 3). Including patients whose propensity score were  between the 25th and 75th percentiles (figure 2) led to an  adjusted HR of 0·56 (95% CI 0·44–0·71) from 3 days  after peak troponin concentration. There was no evi- dence of an association between invasive manage ment  and lower mortality during the first month of follow-up,  although the strongest associations of invasive manage- ment with lower mortality were from 1 year of follow-up  onwards (appendix p 16). The association of invasive  management with lower mortality appeared to attenuate  with increasing age, but smaller patient numbers at the  oldest ages meant that the confidence intervals on age- specific HRs were wide (appendix p 8). The numbers of patients who were invasively managed  during follow-up were 103 (16%) of 655 in the invasive  management group and 161 (19%) of 845 in the non- invasive group (appendix p 17). 120 (14%) of 845 patients  in the non-invasive group were invasively managed  between 4 and 28 days after their peak troponin. However,  the proportion of patients who were invasively managed  after 28 days was smaller for the non-invasive group than  in the invasive group. Invasive management was done  during a recurrent acute coronary syndrome admission  in only 43 (5%) patients in the invasive group and  71 (8%) patients in the non-invasive group. Of those  undergoing further invasive manage ment in the invasive  group, 68 (66%) had revas cularisation, compared with  24 (15%) of those in the non-invasive management group  during their index hospital admission. The number of patients admitted with heart failure  during follow up was 76 (mean 0·20 admissions;  range 0–7) in the invasive group and 127 (mean  0·24 admissions; range 0–6) in the non-invasive group.  At 5 years, the cumulative percentages admitted to  hospital with heart failure were 15% in the invasive group  and 22% in the non-invasive group (appendix p 6). An  inverse probability of treatment weighted Kaplan-Meier  plot estimated 5-year cumulative admission rates to be  14% if all eligible patients were invasively managed and  19% if all eligible patients were non-inva sively managed  (figure 3B). Invasive management was associated with a  lower incidence of hospital admissions for heart failure  than non-invasive management (adjusted incidence rate  Figure 3: Kaplan-Meier curves displaying cumulative all-cause mortality and probability of admission for  heart failure according to invasive and non-invasive management (A) Cumulative all-cause mortality.

Association  between invasive management and additional causes  of hospital admission are reported in the appendix  (pp 2, 18). Discussion We used multicentre routine clinical data from the  NIHR Health Informatics Collaborative to estimate the  effect of invasive management compared with non- invasive management on survival and other outcomes in  patients with NSTEMI aged 80 years or older. We used a  frame work for comparative effectiveness research based  on explicit description of the target trial whose results  would answer the clinical question.14 The estimated  32% lower mortality in patients who receive invasive  management compared with those who receive non- invasive manage ment strengthens the evidence for an  invasive approach. Invasive management was associated  with a lower incidence of heart failure hospitalisations,  acute coronary syndrome, and invasive management  during follow-up. Patients aged 80 years or older represent a growing  proportion of the population presenting with NSTEMI,  but these patients are much less likely to receive invasive  management. Data from the National Inpatient Sample  database in the USA showed that coronary angiography  was done in 78% of patients with NSTEMI aged 60 years  or younger, compared with 38% of patients aged  81 years or older.5 In our study, 49% of eligible patients  underwent invasive management during their index  admission. These differences do not necessarily reflect  ageism, rather they reflect insufficient data to guide  clinical practice. Treatment decisions are often made in  the context of careful evaluation of potential risks and  benefits, estimated life expectancy, and comorbidities.  In our study, patients managed non-invasively had  worse prognosis and were more likely to have a history  of heart failure, chronic kidney disease, malignancy,  and lung disease. Patients managed invasively were  more likely to have higher troponin concentrations,  blood test results within the normal range, and  cardiovascular risk factors (including smoking, family  history of ischaemic heart disease, hypertension, and  hypercholesterolaemia). Such risk factors are generally  associated with better prognosis in patients who have  had an index event, such as myocardial infarction.20,21 The European Society of Cardiology guidelines suggest  that older patients should be considered for invasive  management and revascularisation (class 2a recom men- dation: “conflicting evidence and/or a divergence of opinion  about the usefulness/efficacy of the given treatment or  procedure” but the “weight of evidence/opinion is in favour  of usesfulness/efficacy”.22 The American Heart Association  have a similar guideline recommendation.23 Only two small  randomised trials (After Eighty24 [invasive group n=229 and  non-invasive group n=228] and Italian Elderly ACS Trial25  [invasive group n=154 and non-invasive group n=159]) and  two small post-hoc subgroup analyses of randomised  trials (TACTICS-TIMI 1826 and FIR27) have evaluated inva- sive management versus non-invasive management for  NSTEMI in patients aged 75–80 years or older. A meta- analysis that pooled these data, published in 2017, did not  find clear evidence that invasive management reduced  long-term mortality (OR 0·84, 95% CI 0·66–1·06; p=0·15).28  Number in the  invasive group Number in the  non-invasive group Hazard ratio  (95% CI) p value Primary analysis Multivariable* plus PS adjustment, with deaths within 3 days of peak troponin  concentration assigned to a treatment group based on PS† 686 892 0·68 (0·55–0·84) <0·0001 Sensitivity analyses Crude, excluding deaths within 3 days of peak troponin concentration 655 845 0·38 (0·32–0·46) <0·0001 Multivariable* plus PS adjustment, excluding deaths within 3 days 655 845 0·56 (0·45–0·70) <0·0001 IPTW, excluding deaths within 3 days 655 845 0·66 (0·49–0·88) 0·0050 Multivariable* plus PS adjustment, restricted to patients with PS in the 25th and  75th percentiles, excluding deaths within 3 days 411 528 0·56 (0·44–0·71) <0·0001 Multivariable* plus PS adjustment, with deaths within 3 days of peak troponin  concentration assigned to the non-invasive group 655 923 0·50 (0·40–0·61) <0·0001 Multivariable* plus PS adjustment, with deaths within 3 days of peak troponin  concentration assigned to the invasive group 733 845 1·05 (0·86–1·27) 0·65 IPTW=inverse probability of treatment weighted.

The main limitations of our study relate to its  observational nature: we cannot exclude bias due to  uncontrolled (residual) confounding. However, we took  several steps to minimise bias, using specification of a  target trial to guide our analyses. We assigned patients  who died within 3 days of their peak troponin concen- tration to the two treatment groups according to their  propensity scores, unless they had been invasively  managed before death. 3 days was chosen as the optimal  time to capture most of the patients who underwent  invasive management in our cohort (appendix p 3) and  the median time used in previous randomised trials.24,25  Patients who received invasive management after 3 days  were analysed in the non-invasive group, as would be the  case in an intention-to-treat analysis of a randomised  trial. Confounding by indication is a major concern for  interpretation of our results: patients with worse prog- nosis were markedly more likely to receive non-invasive  management. We considered more than 70 potentially  confounding variables, including patient demographics,  comorbidities, and cardiovascular risk factors. We  excluded patients in the propensity score strata in which  there were few patients or deaths in either group and  controlled for potential confounding by a large range of  prognostic factors. However, our results could be biased  by unmeasured confounding, by factors such as frailty  that might not be well captured in routinely collected  data. We did not have information on whether there was  differential receipt of evidence-based cardiac care in the  non-invasive management group, including prescrip- tion of medications. Additionally, we did not have data  on postadmission prognostic factors that might have  affected choice of invasive or non-invasive management  within the first 3 days. Calculation of the E value  showed that to explain the effect of invasive management  on mortality estimated in our study, an unmeasured  confounder would need at minimum to have a risk ratio  of 1·94 with both undergoing invasive management  and mortality, having controlled for all the measured  confounders.19 Our study strengthens the evidence for an invasive  approach to management of older patients with NSTEMI.  Ideally, clinical decision making should be driven by  randomised trials. However, the only ongoing trial  designed to answer this question is not due for com- pletion until the end of the current decade.13 In the  meantime, clinical decisions need to be made based on  the best available evidence, which suggests that an  invasive approach might be the better strategy for older  patients who could be managed either invasively or non- invasively. Further research into the threshold (based on  prognostic factors and comorbidities) at which invasive  management should be considered would further assist  clinical decision making. Inter pretation is difficult because TACTICS-TIMI 18 com- pared an early invasive with a selective invasive strategy  with predischarge ischaemia test, following which 49% of  patients underwent coronary catheterisation and 32% had  revascularisation.26 Similarly, the FIR trials, which reported  cardiovascular mortality but not all-cause mortality, com- pared an invasive strategy with a selective invasive strategy,  which involved a predischarge ischae mia test, following  which nearly half of patients had revas cularisation  during follow-up.27 In the Italian Elderly ACS Study,  29% of patients randomly assigned to receive non-invasive  management had coronary catheter isation.25 In our study,  161 (19%) of 845 patients analysed in the non-invasive  group underwent invasive manage ment during follow-up,  of whom only 24 (15%) were revascularised. There were  inconsistencies between the four trials with regard to the  timing of angiography after randomisation, ranging from  4 h to 7 days, and the duration of patient follow-up following  randomisation, ranging from 6 months to 5 years.24–27 The ongoing SENIOR-RITA trial13 aims to randomly  assign 2300 patients with NSTEMI aged 75 years or older  to receive invasive or non-invasive management. With  a 5-year follow-up planned, the primary outcome is a  composite of cardiovascular death and non-fatal myocar- dial infarction, with an estimated study completion  in 2029.13 In the absence of compelling evidence from ran- domised trials, a small number of registry studies7–9 have  suggested a benefit from invasive therapy, but the  findings might have been exaggerated by immortal time  bias and the inclusion of very frail patients who were  almost certain to be managed non-invasively. Immortal  time bias can occur when patients who would have  received active intervention are analysed in the no  intervention or conservative intervention group because  they died before active intervention was implemented.10,11  Studies of temporal trends using registry data from  the USA and Europe suggest that over the past 15 years  the progressive switch from a non-invasive to more  invasive approach in older patients with NSTEMI has  been accompanied by declining mortality.5,29,30 We analysed a large, detailed clinical dataset assembled  from routinely collected data on unselected patients.  All-cause mortality is the outcome of most interest to  patients. However, we could not identify deaths that  were related to cardiac pathology. In older patients,  deaths from causes, such as cancer, that are not affected  by management of NSTEMI are common. This suggests  that any effect of invasive management on cardiovascular  mortality is likely to be greater than its effect on all-cause  mortality. We were unable to explore some outcomes of  interest (eg, independent living and quality of life). The  five centres contributing data were all tertiary centres  with most patients being admitted directly. Only  105 (7%) of 1500 patients of the cohort were transferred  from other hospitals to these centres. Therefore, we  believe that the findings are generalisable to other  Articles www.thelancet.com   Vol 396   August 29, 2020  633 On the basis of routinely collected clinical data from  five UK tertiary centres we found that invasive manage- ment in patients aged 80 years or older with NSTEMI was  associated with 32% lower mortality, compared with non- invasive management. The survival advantage bestowed  by invasive management might extend to patients aged  80 years or older with NSTEMI. Contributors AK and JM conceived the hypothesis.

But major  changes in the ACA’s regulatory  environment will require the   cooperation of several federal  agencies and often state regulators  as well. Precipitous changes in the en- forcement of the law would se- verely disrupt insurance markets,  with political, no less than policy  or humanitarian, consequences.  The Congressional  Budget Office proj- ects that gutting the  law would lead com- paratively healthy people to drop  coverage, forcing insurers to raise  premiums or withdraw from mar- kets altogether. Such actions  would, in turn, further shrink  the insurance pool, raise premi- ums, and reduce insurance avail- ability — resulting in an increase  of 18 million in the number of  uninsured Americans by 2018.5  Mulling such prospects, Republi- can strategists, both in and out- side the administration, are re- portedly already having second  thoughts about precipitously sab- otaging the ACA.

P atient risk factors modify the  outcomes of many treatments.  Patients with a high risk of stroke  may benefit more from anticoag- ulation therapy than those with  minor risk. So it is often unclear  to what extent results of clinical  trials that were conducted in se- lected populations are applicable  to populations with different risk- factor profiles. Such uncertainty  often means that physicians and  provider organizations must make  intricate generalizations while  making clinical decisions. How can we translate clinical  trial findings for a target popula- tion that’s likely to use a given  treatment in a community care  setting? There are statistical  methods that can leverage indi- vidual-level data from random- ized, controlled trials (RCTs) and  information about the distribution  of risk factors in a target popula- tion to answer this question. Us- ing these methods, one can re- weight individual-level trial data so  that the risk-factor distributions  in the sample mimic those in the  target population.1 As individual-level trial data  become more readily available to  researchers more quickly,2 imple- menting this method becomes  increasingly feasible, if we know  the distribution of risk factors in  the target population — for ex- ample, the proportion of patients  who have had a transient ische- mic attack (TIA) or a stroke and  therefore have high risk for stroke  in the future. Provider organiza- tions can use their own databases,  such as electronic health records  or claims data, to estimate the  distribution of risk factors in a  target population. Such databases  are representative, are rapidly avail- able at low cost, and reflect rou- tine care patterns. Once organi- zations know the distribution of  risk factors in their target popu- lation and have individual-level  RCT data, they can adapt trial  results for their patient popula- tions, assuming that there is suf- ficient overlap between the trial  and target population to support  such inferences. But there is a catch: risk fac- tors in clinical trials and elec- tronic health care databases are  measured in fundamentally dif- ferent ways. An RCT systemati- cally and in great detail assesses  myriad baseline characteristics,  whereas routine care data are pro- duced in the rush of delivering  the necessary care to patients who  seek care. Consider, for example,  ascertainment of a patient’s his- tory of TIA. In a trial, a TIA is  identified and dated by means of  detailed patient interviews and  may be confirmed on the basis  of carotid Doppler ultrasonogra- phy showing moderate stenosis.  In claims or medical records, by  contrast, an old TIA may not be  recorded at all, and if there is no  The New England Journal of Medicine  Downloaded from nejm.org on March 29, 2017.

PERSPECTIVE 1204 From Trial to Target Populations n engl j med 376;13 nejm.org March 30, 2017 acute problem a Doppler exam is  unlikely to be conducted. And  even if a physician is aware of  the TIA, it may not be recorded  in a given claim because there is  another acute problem, such as  management of uncontrolled dia- betes. Conversely, vasovagal syn- cope might be coded as a TIA for  billing purposes — an occurrence  that may be inconsequential in  terms of billing but that results  in misclassification of clinical  events in the claims data. The fundamentally different  data-generation mechanisms in  RCTs and electronic health care  data result in a situation in which  the risk-factor profiles of identi- cal populations may spuriously  appear quite different (and those  of dissimilar populations may  appear similar) — a problem  that undermines the accuracy of  methods for reweighting RCT  findings. We therefore need a  way to calibrate our measure- ments between these two data  worlds, which requires us to cre- ate overlap in information by fo- cusing on patients for whom we  have both RCT risk-factor data  and electronic health care data  (see diagram). Fortunately, such an informa- tion overlap between clinical trials  and electronic databases can be  created easily and at surprisingly  low cost. Investigators can obtain  consent from patients enrolled in  an RCT to have their insurance  claims data linked to the trial  database. Such linkage is particu- larly feasible for populations with  a single insurer such as Medicare,  which covers patients 65 years of  age or older and those with end- stage renal disease. The overlap  would provide the opportunity to  directly compare claims-based and  trial-based measurements of risk  Using an Overlap between Clinical Trial Participants and a Target Patient Population to Calibrate Risk-Factor Measurement. Some patients in the overlapping population are misclassified in routine health care data. The information overlap can be used  to calibrate riskfactor measurements in routine health care data, permitting more accurate reweighting of the trial findings for  application to the target population. In the overlapped part of the target population, one of three individuals had false positive  results and two of three had false negative results. When we calibrate our measurements, we expect to see the same proportion of  corrections in the whole target population: 8 of 24 were false positive (so were changed to no TIA) and 14 of 21 were false negative  (so were changed to TIA).

Aligning risk-factor  measurements between two data  sources, in turn, would enable  more accurate reweighting of trial  findings. Until recently, individual-level  data from RCTs of newly mar- keted medications were not avail- able to health care organizations  — a limitation that prevented us  from taking advantage of this  low-cost, high-gain opportunity.3  But we are now witnessing im- portant changes in this arena,  and recent initiatives for sharing  individual-level clinical trial data  may become even more wide- spread in light of the Internation- al Committee of Medical Journal  Editors policy on requiring trial  sponsors to propose their data- sharing plans at trial registration.4 Additional benefits can be  achieved by creating this infor- mation overlap. Electronic health  care databases, if directly validat- ed using clinical trial data, can be  used in following trial participants  and capturing long-term outcomes  that occur after the trial period  ends. Comparative effectiveness  and safety studies based on elec- tronic health care databases can  also, in some circumstances, ex- amine additional indications be- yond those included in the initial  medication label — a possibility  that the Food and Drug Adminis- tration is looking into.5 We suggest that obtaining clin- ical trial participants’ information  recorded in electronic health care  databases should become an in- tegral part of clinical trials. Such  a change would enable many pro- vider organizations to apply RCT  findings to their own target pa- tient populations. All this can be  accomplished without imposing a  substantial additional burden or  cost on investigators conducting  standard clinical trials, given that  information routinely collected in  electronic databases is readily  available in most practical situa- tions. Consent would have to be  obtained from trial participants,  but experience has shown that  patients are much more willing  to share their health data than we  may assume, if doing so will  help improve other patients’ care.  We believe that it is our ethical  responsibility both to ensure that  we get as much use as possible  out of any knowledge we gain by  involving patients in clinical ex- periments and to maximize the  benefit and minimize the risk for  others who are affected by the  condition under investigation.

Arch Dis Child Fetal Neonatal Ed Published Online First: [please include Day Month Year] doi:10.1136/archdischild- 2016-311581 ABSTRACT Background Tolerating higher partial pressures of carbon dioxide (PCO2) in mechanically ventilated extremely low birthweight infants to reduce ventilator- induced lung injury may have long-term neurodevelopmental side effects. This study analyses the results of neurodevelopmental follow-up of infants enrolled in a randomised multicentre trial. Methods Infants (n=359) between 400 and 1000 g birth weight and 23 0/7–28 6/7 weeks gestational age who required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation within 24 hours of birth were randomly assigned to high PCO2 or to a control group with mildly elevated PCO2 targets. Neurodevelopmental follow-up examinations were available for 85% of enrolled infants using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II, the Gross Motor Function Classiﬁcation System (GMFCS) and the Child Development Inventory (CDI). Results There were no differences in body weight, length and head circumference between the two PCO2 target groups. Median Mental Developmental Index (MDI) values were 82 (60–96, high target) and 84 (58– 96, p=0.79). Psychomotor Developmental Index (PDI) values were 84 (57–100) and 84 (65–96, p=0.73), respectively. Moreover, there was no difference in the number of infants with MDI or PDI <70 or <85 and the number of infants with a combined outcome of death or MDI<70 and death or PDI<70. No differences were found between results for GMFCS and CDI. The risk factors for MDI<70 or PDI<70 were intracranial haemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, periventricular leukomalacia, necrotising enterocolitis and hydrocortisone treatment. Conclusions A higher PCO2 target did not inﬂuence neurodevelopmental outcomes in mechanically ventilated extremely preterm infants. Adjusting PCO2 targets to optimise short-term outcomes is a safe option. Trial registration number ISRCTN56143743. INTRODUCTION Extremely preterm infants who survive intensive care are at high risk for developmental abnormal- ities.1 2 Treatments that appear beneﬁcial in the short term, such as corticosteroids, may carry salient adverse effects that can only be demon- strated through careful follow-up examinations.3 For this reason, neurodevelopmental follow-up examinations are an important part of randomised trials involving this highly vulnerable patient group. Permissive hypercapnia (PHC)—intentionally reducing tidal volumes while allowing alveolar hypoventilation and increased blood partial pres- sure of carbon dioxide (PCO2)—has been advo- cated as a means to decrease ventilator-induced lung injury and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).4 Because BPD is a risk factor for poor neu- rodevelopmental outcomes, measures that decrease lung injury may decrease this risk.5 Furthermore, PHC may also inﬂuence neurodevelopmental out- comes because of its effects on cerebral perfusion, oxygen delivery and cell metabolism.6 Previous data on neurodevelopmental follow-up after PHC is sparse. One trial did not publicise neurodevelopmental follow-up data.7 In a What is already known on this topic? ▸ In ventilator-dependent preterm infants, a strategy of mildly elevated pressures of carbon dioxide (PCO2) targets as compared with normocapnia was not associated with any changes to neurodevelopmental outcomes. ▸ In one small study, there was a possible association between higher PCO2 targets and worse neurodevelopmental outcomes. What this study adds? ▸ This large multicentre trial demonstrated that higher PCO2 targets, as compared with mildly elevated PCO2 targets, had no impact on neurodevelopmental outcomes.

We hypothesised that neurodevelopment might be similar in both study groups. METHODS Patient allocation The PHELBI trial enrolled inborn infants with a gestational age of 23 0/7–28 6/7 weeks, weighing 400–1000 g and receiving endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation within 24 hours of birth at 16 tertiary care perinatal centres in Germany (see online supplementary appendix 1 and 2). Infants were allocated and randomised between March 2008 and July 2012. The trial was approved by each centre’s institutional review board and written informed consent was obtained from the parents or legal guardians of all infants. Study intervention The treatment differed between study groups only in the target ranges of the PCO2. In both groups, an age-dependent PCO2 increase was permitted to facilitate weaning. ▸ High target (experimental intervention): PaCO2 target range 55–65 mm Hg from 1 to 3 days of life (0–72 hours), 60– 70 mm Hg from days 4 to 6 (73–144 hours) and 65– 75 mm Hg from days 7 to 14. ▸ Control target: PaCO2 target range 40–50 mm Hg from days 1 to 3 (0–72 hours), 45–55 mm Hg from days 4 to 6 (73– 144 hours) and 50–60 mm Hg from days 7 to 14. Target ranges were applied to all intubated infants until the end of the 14th day of life. A detailed description of the trial protocol is available elsewhere.11 Outcome assessments All surviving infants were invited to a neurodevelopmental follow-up examination at 2 years±3 months corrected age. All possible efforts were made to reach all families. The Psychomotor Developmental Index (PDI) and the Mental Developmental Index (MDI) were determined using Bayley Scales of Infant Development II (BSIDII) in their validated German translation. Scores were assessed relative to a standar- dised mean±SD of 100±15, with higher scores indicating better performance.12 The motor function was assessed by the modiﬁed Gross Motor Function Classiﬁcation System (GMFCS), with scores ranging from level 0 (normal) to level 5 (most impaired).13 As well, parents were asked to complete a Child Development Inventory (CDI) questionnaire14 in its vali- dated German translation, the ‘Elternfragebogen zur kindlichen Entwicklung im Kleinkindalter’.15 16 The short form of the CDI with 70 questions concerning general development was used. Blindness and deafness were assessed by parent interviews. Intraventricular haemorrhages were classiﬁed according to Papile et al17 by a single paediatric radiologist as reported in the previous publication.11 On-site monitoring was performed by the Interdisciplinary Centre for Clinical Trials (IZKS) in Mainz, Germany. A database was programmed and all data were entered in duplicate. Statistical considerations Statistical tests used in this study were the χ2 test, Fisher’s exact test, Student’s t-test and Mann-Whitney U test. Univariate logis- tic regression analyses were performed to identify possible risk factors, including the randomised group assignment, for MDI<85, MDI<70, PDI<85 or PDI<70, neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) or the end points mentioned combined with death. Risk factors that yielded signiﬁcant differences in univari- ate analyses were fed into multiple logistic regressions to deter- mine which conditions constituted independent risk factors for MDI or PDI results <85 or <70. All analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis, but have to be considered secondary and hypothesis-generating since the sample size had not been tailored to these outcome variables. Adjustments for multiple testing were not done. A p value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically signiﬁcant. SAS software 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA) was used throughout. The trial was registered: ISRCTN56143743. RESULTS Of the 359 patients enrolled in the main trial, 44 died and 315 completed the trial (ﬁgure 1). There were four additional late deaths. One infant (control group, classiﬁed as having BPD) died 1 day after completing the trial, two others (1 high target, 1 control, classiﬁed as having BPD) within the ﬁrst year, and one infant, also high target, but who had not met the trial’s BPD criteria, died at 2 years corrected age. Of the remaining 311 infants, 265 participated in the follow-up exams and 46 Figure 1 The graph shows the number of infants from enrolment to follow-up. Of infants who were still alive, 85% were included in the follow-up and 75% had complete data for neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI). F2 Thome UH, et al.

Assuming that all lost infants were alive, the resulting follow-up rate was at least 85% of sur- vivors. There were no signiﬁcant differences in basic neonatal data between those followed-up and those lost to follow-up (table 1) as well as between both study groups (table 2). Most importantly, the rates of moderate-to-severe BPD and intraven- tricular haemorrhages were not signiﬁcantly different. Weight at the time of discharge was also similar. However, signiﬁcantly more infants in the high target group had suffered from NEC, as described in the report of the main trial.11 The results of the neurodevelopmental follow-up examina- tions are given in table 3. Not all infants were able to complete all follow-up examinations, therefore, the actual number of infants contributing data to each item is also given. MDI and PDI values were very similar in both study groups, as were the rates of infants with MDI or PDI values below 85 or 70. The combined rate of poor outcomes did not differ between both study groups. Cerebral palsy as measured by higher GMFCS scores was evenly distributed between both study groups, nor was there any difference in parental assessment of their child’s develop- ment according to CDI. Rates of hearing or visual impairments were also similar. As well, the growth of children in both groups was comparable, as shown by similar weight, height and head circumference at the time of the follow-up exams. Age at the follow-up exams was also similar and not suggestive of con- founding effects. Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed several risk factors for low MDI and PDI scores, as indicators of poor neurological outcomes (tables 4–7). Main risk factors for MDI<85 were periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), NEC and BPD. For MDI<70, risk factors were PVL, NEC and use of hydrocortisone during the neonatal period. No such association was found with dexamethasone, which however, was only used infrequently. Main risk factors for a PDI<85 were intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), NEC and BPD. For PDI<70, risk factors were IVH, NEC and use of hydrocortisone during the neonatal period. A relationship between the cumula- tive hydrocortisone dose and MDI or PDI was not found (data not shown). There was a signiﬁcant association between cerebral palsy as assessed by GMFCS scores and IVH, severe IVH, PVL, NEC and BPD (data not shown). DISCUSSION In this multicentre trial comparing different levels of hypercap- nia, PCO2 target assignment did not affect neurodevelopmental outcomes. There were no differences in the resulting MDI, PDI, GMFCS and CDI scores nor in the number of infants with poor scores. Furthermore, there were also no differences in the pro- portion of children with cerebral palsy or neurosensory impair- ments. The PCO2 targets were neither protective nor harmful to the nervous system.

As previously noted, these results must be interpreted in light of the speciﬁc inclusion cri- teria for this trial.11 Only extremely low birthweight infants requiring endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical venti- lation were eligible for this trial, in settings where non-invasive support was the preferred method. This led to preferred inclu- sion of less stable infants who were more likely to have pro- nounced respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and other complications of prematurity, and probably at higher risk of a suboptimal neurodevelopment. A direct linkage between RDS and cerebral abnormalities has been established in animal experiments.18 Aside from the selection of very ill infants for enrolment, this trial was unique in several aspects regarding the selected PCO2 targets. First, the target for the control group was not normocapnia, but rather mild hypercapnia, because a previous trial had indicated some advantages associated with Table 3 Overall outcome indicators, by randomised group High target (n=130) Control (n=135) p Value MDI* 82 (49–120, 122) 84 (49–118, 127) 0.79 MDI<85 67/122 (55) 64/127 (50) 0.47 MDI<70 37/122 (30) 41/127 (32) 0.74 PDI* 84 (49–114, 109) 84 (49–114, 117) 0.73 PDI<85 56/109 (51) 62/117 (53) 0.81 PDI<70 36/109 (33) 39/117 (33) 0.96 Total mortality by follow-up 27/179 (15) 21/180 (12) 0.34 Hearing impairment 8/127 (6) 5/132 (4) 0.35 Visual impairment 24/127 (19) 26/133 (20) 0.89 NDI (MDI<70 or PDI<70 or hearing impairment or visual impairment) 58/115 (50) 57/118 (48) 0.75 NDI or death 85/142 (60) 78/139 (56) 0.52 GMFCS level 0 64 (49) 69 (51) 0.23 GMFCS level 1 40 (31) 49 (36) GMFCS level 2 13 (10) 4 (3) GMFCS level 3 4 (3) 6 (4) GMFCS level 4 7 (5) 6 (4) GMFCS level 5 2 (2) 1 (1) CDI score* 22 (1–50, 95) 23 (1–58, 88) 0.56 Percentiles for CDI scores† 5 (<2—>90) 10 (<2—>90) Weight at follow-up (kg)* 10.5 (5·6–15.0, 122) 10.5 (7.0–17.2, 132) 0.84 Height at follow-up (cm)* 84 (66–96, 121) 85 (70–102, 132) 0.40 Head circumference (cm)* 47 (40–52, 123) 47 (43–50, 130) 0.54 Corrected age at follow-up (months)* 24 (18–28) 24 (19–31) 0.46 Unless otherwise specified, data are given as number of infants (%), χ2 test. *Median (minimum–maximum, n), Mann-Whitney U-test. †According to the standard sample: median (minimum–maximum).

In this trial, about 50% of infants were found to be neurodevelop- mentally impaired and roughly one-third had MDI or PDI values below 70, quite similar to the results presented here. There were no signiﬁcant differences between the PCO2 target groups in that trial. It is important to note that the PCO2 targets in the experimental group of that trial were closer to those of the control group than to the high target group of the trial presented here. A subsequent monocentric trial aimed for larger PCO2 differ- ences with target values of 35–45 mm Hg in the control group and 55–65 in the experimental group.9 The mean PCO2 differ- ence actually achieved was 6 mm Hg. This trial showed worrying but non-signiﬁcant trends towards poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes in the high target group, with a signiﬁcant difference in the number of infants with the composite outcome of death or MDI<70, raising the suspicion that high PCO2 values might potentially be harmful to the brain. Later, retrospective analyses also linked higher PCO2 values to a worse neurodevelopmental outcome, although PCO2 might have been a surrogate for illness severity.19 20 However, this concern no longer seems justiﬁed since our data with even higher PCO2 targets in the experimen- tal group and a mean PCO2 difference of 6 mm Hg did not show any signiﬁcant deviations or trends towards poorer neuro- developmental outcomes. It appears that, unlike epithelial cells,21–23 neuronal tissue may not be as susceptible to higher PCO2 values or lower pH values. Associations identiﬁed between ﬂuctuations of PCO2 and intraventricular haemor- rhage20 24 may reﬂect PCO2-associated changes in brain perfu- sion rather than direct neuronal damage. One of the largest recent respiratory management trials in preterm infants compared a strategy favouring non-invasive con- tinuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and an upper PCO2 limit of 65 mm Hg for intubation and extubation with a strategy of using primary intubation, surfactant administration and an upper PCO2 limit of 50 mm Hg.25 There were, however, no lower limits for the PCO2 and enrolment was not limited to infants with more severe RDS. Similarly to the trial reported here, neurodevelopmental outcomes did not differ between study groups.10 Respiratory morbidities, however, were signiﬁ- cantly reduced in the CPAP group at 18–22 months,26 which might, given the experience of earlier trials, correlate with neu- rodevelopmental performance at school age.27 The search for risk factors for low MDI and PDI scores led to several interesting insights. PVL and IVH were strong predictors of poor outcomes, as has been seen previously.28 29 PVL, a manifestation of global brain injury, was mainly associated with low MDI scores, indicating impaired mental performance. IVH, on the other hand, which is a manifestation of localised brain injury, was more associated with low PDI scores, indicating impaired motor performance. NEC was universally associated with low MDI and PDI scores. BPD was only found to have a signiﬁcant association with MDI or PDI scores below 85, but not with scores below 70, possibly reﬂecting the fact that the number of infants with scores below 70 was too low to yield a signiﬁcant association with BPD. Interestingly, MDI or PDI scores below 70 were associated with a history of postnatal hydrocortisone treatment, which may either indicate that hydro- cortisone may not be a harmless steroid,30 or that it was more likely to be administered to higher risk infants. Dexamethasone was rarely used, which might explain why no signiﬁcant associa- tions between neurodevelopmental outcomes and dexametha- sone use were found. Limitations of this study include the sample size, which was not powered for the outcome parameters investigated because neurodevelopmental parameters were not the primary outcome. Furthermore, 15% of infants were lost to follow-up and about 10% did not complete all follow-up examinations. Reasons included parents seeking follow-up care elsewhere, for example, closer to their home. Such follow-up, however, was often not very standardised and incomplete, and lacked quality control, often did not include a Bayley test, and was therefore not con- sidered for our follow-up study. Nevertheless, MDI scores were obtained for 80% of all surviving infants, PDI scores for 73% and NDI status was determined for 75%. The infants’ inability to complete tests was mostly related to poor neurodevelopmen- tal status, that is, if all tests had been completed, even lower scores could have been expected. Further difﬁculties arose because of language barriers with immigrant families, mainly from southern Europe, which considerably reduced the number of CDI questionnaires completed. There was no relationship between randomisation and the inability of an infant to be scored, so we conclude that a confounding effect on any differ- ences between the groups is unlikely. Another limitation was that visual and hearing impairments were not conﬁrmed by tests at the time of follow-up. It was not possible to include add- itional testing because the follow-up visits were considered by families to be very time-consuming and demanding on the infants, who frequently came from great distances to the test sites. Furthermore, follow-up at 24 months may not relate with Table 7 ORs for the risk of PDI <70 determined using multiple logistic regression analysis OR (95% CI) p Value Gestational age 1.007 (0.737 to 1.377) 0.96 Birth weight 1.00 (0.997 to 1.003) 0.98 SGA (yes or no)* 1.826 (0.607 to 5.494) 0.28 Moderate or severe BPD† 1.934 (0.987 to 3.787) 0.055 IVH grade 1–2 2.227 (1.092 to 4.541) 0.028 IVH grade 3–4 3.988 (1.622 to 9.802) 0.0026 PVL (yes or no) 1.365 (0.476 to 3.914) 0.56 NEC 4.491 (1.359 to 14.837) 0.014 Hydrocortisone given (yes or no) 2.303 (1.154 to 4.598) 0.018 Bicarbonate given (yes or no) 1.311 (0.759 to 2.265) 0.33 All factors listed in this table were shown to be statistically significant using univariate regression analysis.

Finally, a number of univariate and mul- tiple analyses were performed, increasing the likelihood of random differences. It may also be noted that some results tended to be worse in the high target group, and the incidence of NEC was signiﬁ- cantly increased. While all trends in this follow-up study remained non-signiﬁcant, a type II error cannot be excluded. A limitation to all studies using the translated BSIDII in Germany is the lack of a formal validation, which was never performed because results closely resembled those obtained on American infants (normal mean±SD=100±15) and the Dutch validation revealed only minimal deviations.31 Strengths of this work include the large sample size, and a reasonable follow-up rate,29 resulting in the largest follow-up study of infants ever randomised to different PCO2 targets with other management aspects held constant. The preferred inclusion of infants with the most severe respiratory distress and thus most at risk for suboptimal neurodevelopment at enrolment led to a high pro- portion of impaired infants with consequent improved statistical power for the sample size. In summary, there were no signiﬁcant differences in neurode- velopmental outcomes at 2 years between preterm infants requir- ing intubation and mechanical ventilation when randomised to different PCO2 targets after birth. Risk factors for a poor outcome were similar to earlier trials with neurodevelopmental follow-up, but did not include the randomised group assign- ment. We conclude that a strategy using PHC did not appear to have any detectable positive or negative effects on neurodevelop- mental outcomes. PCO2 targets for ventilated preterm infants should therefore be tailored to optimise short-term outcomes.8 11 In this regard, the signiﬁcant higher NEC rate in the high target group is worrisome. Whether PCO2 targets during neonatal care inﬂuence neurodevelopmental outcomes at school age or adoles- cence cannot be determined at this stage.

BACKGROUND Evidence to support the choice of blood-pressure targets for the treatment of coma- tose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who are receiving intensive care is  limited. METHODS In a double-blind, randomized trial with a 2-by-2 factorial design, we evaluated a  mean arterial blood-pressure target of 63 mm Hg as compared with 77 mm Hg in  comatose adults who had been resuscitated after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest  of presumed cardiac cause; patients were also assigned to one of two oxygen tar- gets (reported separately). The primary outcome was a composite of death from  any cause or hospital discharge with a Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) of 3 or  4 within 90 days (range, 0 to 5, with higher categories indicating more severe dis- ability; a category of 3 or 4 indicates severe disability or coma). Secondary outcomes  included neuron-specific enolase levels at 48 hours, death from any cause, scores  on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (range, 0 to 30, with higher scores indicat- ing better cognitive ability) and the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 to 6, with  higher scores indicating greater disability) at 3 months, and the CPC at 3 months. RESULTS A total of 789 patients were included in the analysis (393 in the high-target group  and 396 in the low-target group). A primary-outcome event occurred in 133 pa- tients (34%) in the high-target group and in 127 patients (32%) in the low-target  group (hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84 to 1.37; P = 0.56). At  90 days, 122 patients (31%) in the high-target group and 114 patients (29%) in the  low-target group had died (hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.46). The median  CPC was 1 (interquartile range, 1 to 5) in both the high-target group and the low- target group; the corresponding median modified Rankin scale scores were 1  (interquartile range, 0 to 6) and 1 (interquartile range, 0 to 6), and the correspond- ing median Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores were 27 (interquartile range, 24  to 29) and 26 (interquartile range, 24 to 29). The median neuron-specific enolase  level at 48 hours was also similar in the two groups. The percentages of patients  with adverse events did not differ significantly between the groups. CONCLUSIONS Targeting a mean arterial blood pressure of 77 mm Hg or 63 mm Hg in patients  who had been resuscitated from cardiac arrest did not result in significantly dif- ferent percentages of patients dying or having severe disability or coma.

Methods Trial Design In the BOX trial, an investigator-initiated, dual- center, randomized trial with a 2-by-2 factorial  design, we assigned comatose patients who had  been resuscitated after an out-of-hospital cardiac  arrest to be treated to meet one of two blood- pressure targets (a double-blind intervention)  and to undergo restrictive oxygenation or liberal  oxygenation (an open-label intervention) while  the patient remained in the intensive care unit  (ICU). Randomization was performed from  March 2017 through December 2021 at two ter- tiary cardiac arrest centers in Denmark with the  use of a Web-based system, random permuted  blocks of sizes 2, 4, and 6, and stratification ac- cording to randomization site. Furthermore, pa- tients underwent a subordinate randomization  to undergo device-based fever control after the  first 24 hours. The results for the oxygen-target  intervention are reported separately,10 and the  results of the assessment of fever control are not  included. Danish legislation permits the immediate  inclusion of patients who are unable to provide  consent in clinical trials if delayed proxy consent  is obtained from a legal representative, most  often a relative, and a medical doctor with no  relation to the trial. Informed consent from the  patient was obtained if the patient regained con- sciousness, and if the patient died, the need for  consent was waived. The protocol (available with  the full text of this article at NEJM.org) was ap- proved by the Regional Ethics Committee of the  Capital Region of Denmark before initiation of  the trial. The trial was designed and overseen by  the steering committee (see the Supplementary  Appendix, available at NEJM.org), data were col- lected by the authors and analyzed by the first  two authors, and the first author wrote the first  draft of the manuscript. The authors vouch for  the accuracy and completeness of the data and  for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol. Ad- ditional details of the trial design have been  published previously.11 Patients Adult patients (≥18 years of age) who had been  resuscitated after an out-of-hospital cardiac ar- rest with a presumed cardiac cause were eligible  for inclusion if they had a sustained return of  spontaneous circulation (i.e., no chest compres- sions for >20 minutes) and remained comatose  (i.e., were not able to obey verbal commands) on  arrival at the hospital. Key exclusion criteria in- cluded unwitnessed asystole and suspected acute  intracranial bleeding or stroke. A complete list  of all inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided  in the Supplementary Appendix. Treatment Protocol Patients were treated in accordance with guide- lines at the discretion of the treating physician.  For the duration of the trial, all patients received  temperature control to maintain a temperature  of 36°C for 24 hours in accordance with guide- lines for comatose patients who had had an out- of-hospital cardiac arrest.12,13 Patients were re- ceiving mechanical ventilation and were sedated,  primarily with the use of propofol and fentanyl.  Temperature control was achieved with surface  cooling (CritiCool and Allon, Belmont Medical  Figure 1 (facing page). Blood Pressure and Vasopressor  Use over the First 48 Hours. Panel A shows blood‑pressure target assignments and  mean blood pressure during the first 48 hours after  randomization. Panels B and C show norepinephrine  doses (Panel B) and vasopressor–inotropic scores  (Panel C) during the first 48 hours after randomization.  The before‑randomization (BR) time point is the first  available blood‑pressure value before randomization,  and time 0 is the time of randomization (i.e., the first  measurement obtained with the trial‑specific blood‑ pressure module). The high blood‑pressure target was  77 mm Hg, and the low blood‑pressure target was   63 mm Hg. Values shown are means, and error bars   indicate the standard deviation. During the period from  2 to 48 hours after randomization, the mean between‑ group difference in blood pressure was 10.5 mm Hg  (95% CI, 9.9 to 11.2), the mean difference in norepi‑ nephrine dose was 0.038 μg per kilogram per minute  (95% CI, 0.026 to 0.049), and the mean difference in  vasopressor–inotropic score was 3.5 points (95% CI,  2.4 to 4.6). A definition of the vasopressor–inotropic  score is provided in the Supplementary Appendix; higher  scores indicate a higher degree of pharmacologic circu‑ latory support.

After  completion of the 24-hour period of temperature  control, the core temperature was gradually in- creased to normothermia with a rewarming rate  of less than 0.5°C per hour, and sedation was  tapered. Assessment of neurologic outcomes  was performed by the attending physician in ac- cordance with guidelines.14 Trial Intervention Clinical staff, investigators, patients, and out- come assessors were unaware of the assigned  blood-pressure targets. For all enrolled patients,  invasive blood-pressure monitoring with a patient- specific blood-pressure module (M1006B Inva- sive Blood Pressure Module, Philips) was used  for as long as the patient underwent invasive  blood-pressure monitoring in the ICU. These  modules had been modified for trial use by ad- justing the internal calibration to report a blood  pressure that was either 10% higher or 10%  lower than the actual blood pressure, depending  on the assigned blood-pressure target. Thus,  by targeting a mean arterial blood pressure of  70 mm Hg in all patients, half the patients would  have an actual target mean arterial blood pres- sure of 63 mm Hg (low-target group) and the  other half would have a target mean arterial  blood pressure of 77 mm Hg (high-target group). The offset of the blood-pressure modules was  performed at a Core Laboratory at the Technical  Department, Rigshospitalet, which had no other  part in the trial execution. The patients under- went randomization as soon as possible after  arrival at the hospital, usually in the ICU and  before invasive monitoring of the systemic arte- rial pressure was established. After randomiza- tion, systemic arterial blood pressure was mea- sured with the trial-specific module only. Other  invasive pressure measurements (i.e., central  venous pressure or pulmonary artery catheter  measurements) were obtained without blinding  with modules that had no offset of calibration. The protocol provided a recommendation for  achieving the mean arterial blood pressure of  70 mm Hg in a three-stage approach: volume  resuscitation to a central venous pressure of  10 mm Hg, norepinephrine infusion, and the  addition of a dopamine infusion for a maximal  dose of 10 μg per kilogram of body weight per  minute, if needed. Information on the use of  vasoactive drugs, including doses, was obtained  from electronic ICU databases, and the maximal  dose for a given period was captured. The total  amount of pharmacologic circulatory support  was quantified as the vasopressor–inotropic  score (higher scores indicate a higher degree of  support)15,16 (see the Supplementary Appendix). Outcome Measures The primary outcome was a composite of death  from any cause or discharge from the hospital  with a Cerebral Performance Category (CPC)17,18  of 3 or 4, indicating severe disability or a coma  or vegetative state, within 90 days after random- ization (categories range from 1 [no symptoms]  to 5 [death]). For patients who were discharged  alive with a CPC of 3 or 4, events were recorded  at the time of discharge. Secondary outcomes  included death from any cause within 90 days,  time to renal-replacement therapy, neuron-spe- cific enolase levels at 48 hours after randomiza- tion, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment score19  at 3 months, the modified Rankin scale score at  3 months, and the CPC at 3 months.20,21 Scores  on the modified Rankin scale range from 0 to 6,  Figure 2.

The Montreal Cogni- tive Assessment tests different types of cognitive  abilities and assigns a score between 0 and 30,  with a score of 26 or higher being normal. As- sessment of the CPC, the modified Rankin scale  score, and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment  score was performed by trained research person- nel. Because of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19)  pandemic restrictions, these assessments were  performed in a telephone interview or through  review of hospital charts for some patients,  which excluded the use of the Montreal Cogni- tive Assessment in these patients. The adverse events included in this report are  bleeding, infection, arrhythmia, electrolyte or  metabolic abnormalities, acute kidney injury  with renal-replacement therapy, and seizures.11  Plasma levels of neuron-specific enolase in pa- tients who were alive at 48 hours were deter- mined by means of electrochemiluminescence  (Roche Diagnostics) and with a Cobas analyzer  system (Roche Diagnostics) in accordance with  the manufacturer’s instructions. Statistical Analysis Our previous data indicate that 6-month mortal- ity among hospitalized comatose patients who  have been resuscitated after an out-of-hospital  cardiac arrest is 33%.22 For the estimation of  sample size, we assumed that there was no in- teraction with the oxygenation intervention.

There- fore, inclusion of a total of 800 patients was  planned, with follow-up for all patients con- tinuing until 3 months after the final patient  had been enrolled. Global type I error for the  trial was 0.05, and the two-sided alpha level for  the analysis of the primary outcome was 0.0471  after correction for the two planned interim  analyses. The mean between-group difference  in blood pressure, norepinephrine dose, and  vasopressor–inotropic score during the period  from 2 to 48 hours after randomization was  calculated in a repeated-measures variance  component model. The primary outcome and the secondary out- comes relating to death from any cause and re- ceipt of renal-replacement therapy were adjusted  for site in a proportional-hazards model. The  assumption of proportional hazards was ful- filled. Because the statistical analysis plan did  not include a provision for correcting for multi- plicity, the results for efficacy outcomes other  than the primary outcome are reported as point  estimates and 95% confidence intervals, and the  intervals should not be used in place of a hy- pothesis test. Event-free survival was assessed in  a Kaplan–Meier analysis. In prespecified subgroup analyses of the  primary outcome, we evaluated subgroups based  on sex, median age, site, and status with re- spect to known chronic obstructive pulmonary  disease (COPD), hypertension (receipt of anti- hypertensive drugs) or renal disease (glomeru- lar filtration rate <30 ml per minute per 1.73 m2  of body-surface area or current renal-replace- ment therapy), shockable primary rhythm, and  acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarc- tion. The statistical analysis plan included an  analysis of Montreal Cognitive Assessment  scores in which missing scores and scores for  deceased patients were included as the lowest  score measured in the trial population (i.e.,  15).11 A two-sided P value of less than 0.05 was  considered to indicate statistical significance.  Statistical analyses were performed with the  use of SAS Enterprise statistical software, ver- sion 3.8 (SAS Institute). Results Patients A total of 802 patients were enrolled in the trial  from March 2017 through December 2021. The  screening and inclusion of patients is shown in  Figure S1 in the Supplementary Appendix. Con- sent was withdrawn for 12 patients (use of data  was not allowed), and 1 patient underwent ran- domization twice, leaving 789 patients in the  trial population. Four patients died before the  intervention was initiated, and in 2 patients  the blood-pressure intervention was stopped by  the treating physician because of hemodynamic  instability; all 6 of these patients remained in  the analyses. The median time from cardiac ar- rest to randomization was 146 minutes (inter- quartile range, 113 to 187). Two non-Danish  patients were transferred and lost to follow-up;  data for these patients were censored on the day  when the modified Rankin scale score and CPC  were recorded (on day 12 for one patient and on  day 13 for the other). The baseline characteris- tics of the patients were well balanced in the two  blood-pressure target groups (Tables 1 and S2). Blood-Pressure Intervention Separation of the blood-pressure values for the  high-target and low-target groups was apparent  from the first value measured by the offset  blood-pressure module, with a mean difference  of 10.7 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI],  10.0 to 11.4) between the groups. The norepineph- rine dose and the vasopressor–inotropic score  were higher in the high-target group than in the  low-target group (Fig. 1). Outcomes and Adverse Events At 90 days, 133 patients (34%) in the high-target  group and 127 patients (32%) in the low-target  group had been discharged from the hospital  with a CPC of 3 or 4 or had died (hazard ratio,  1.08; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.37; P = 0.56) (Table 2 and  Fig. 2). A total of 24 patients (3%) had been dis- charged from the hospital with a CPC of 3 or 4:  11 in the high-target group and 13 in the low- target group. No interaction with the oxygen- target intervention was found (P = 0.67). The re- sults appeared to be consistent across most of  the prespecified subgroups (Fig. 3).

Renal-replacement therapy was initiated  within the first 5 days in 41 patients (10%) in  the high-target group and 40 patients (10%)  in the low-target group (hazard ratio, 1.03; 95%  CI, 0.66 to 1.59). The Montreal Cognitive Assessment score  was available for 359 of the 552 patients (65%)  who were alive at 3 months. Data on the CPC,  modified Rankin scale score, and Montreal Cog- nitive Assessment score at 3 months and on  plasma levels of neuron-specific enolase at 48  hours are summarized in Table 2. The distribu- tions of results on the CPC and modified Rankin  scale are shown in Figure S4. Data on median  neuron-specific enolase levels were available for  79% of the patients; the median level was 18 μg  per liter (interquartile range, 11 to 37) in the  high-target group and 18 μg per liter (interquar- tile range, 11 to 34) in the low-target group. No  significant differences were found in the per- centages of patients with adverse events, includ- ing infection, arrhythmia, bleeding, and seizures  (Table 2). Discussion In this double-blind, randomized trial compar- ing two clinically relevant mean arterial blood- pressure targets, we found no significant differ- ence in the percentage of patients who died or  were discharged from the hospital with a poor  neurologic outcome (CPC of 3 or 4) within 90  days. The results were consistent in the pre- specified subgroups. Our results add to those of two smaller, open- label trials of blood-pressure targets in postresus- citation care in which findings on magnetic  resonance imaging of the head6 and levels of  neuron-specific enolase were used as markers of  the extent of neurologic brain injury.7 In these  two trials, mean pressures of approximately 70  to 74 mm Hg in the lower target range and 84 to  87 mm Hg in the higher target range were at- tained, and the neuron-specific enolase levels  were 20 to 22 μg per liter in one trial7 and 42  to 59 μg per liter in the other,6 as compared  with 35 to 36 μg per liter in the present trial.  At 6 months, 70%7 and 45%6 of the patients in  the two trials were alive, as compared with 67%  of the patients in the current trial. Perfusion of the brain depends on the mean  arterial pressure and is controlled through cere- brovascular autoregulation to ensure adequate  perfusion at varying blood pressures. After an  out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, this delicate bal- ance between flow and pressure may be dis- rupted, with lower perfusion at a given pressure  during the first 12 to 24 hours after the cardiac  arrest.23,24 Observational data suggest that the  mean arterial blood pressure that should be  used to secure flow to the postanoxic brain is at  least 75 mm Hg,25 whereas guidelines suggest  that mean arterial pressure should be main- tained above 65 mm Hg.1,14 Maintenance of a  higher mean arterial pressure in the postresus- citation period may be warranted in patients  with preexisting hypertension.23 In patients with  sepsis, targeting a higher blood pressure has  been associated with lower rates of dialysis  among those with preexisting hypertension.26  Our results do not suggest a benefit of a higher  blood-pressure target in the subgroup of pa- tients with known hypertension. The interaction of preexisting COPD favoring  a high blood-pressure target is likely to be spuri- ous and should be interpreted with great cau- tion. In addition, as compared with the lower  target, the higher blood-pressure target in our  trial was not associated with an increased risk of  adverse events. In contrast, a higher blood pres- sure in patients with sepsis has previously been  associated with increased risk of arrhythmia.26 Our trial has limitations. The mean differ- ence in blood pressure between the groups was  10.7 mm Hg and therefore was lower than the  expected value (14 mm Hg). However, since a  clinically significant separation in blood pres- sure was observed between the groups, and the  doses of norepinephrine and vasopressor were  substantially higher in the high-target group  than in the low-target group, we believe that the  trial provides strong evidence for an absence of  clinically important differences in the assessed  outcomes, although our findings cannot be ex- trapolated to blood-pressure targets that are  higher or lower than those used in this trial.  Although the hypothesized treatment effect may  be seen as overly optimistic, given the consis- tency of the results in the two groups, the risk  of type 2 error seems low. Follow-up in our trial was challenging as a  result of Covid-19 restrictions, including a tem- The New England Journal of Medicine  Downloaded from nejm.org at GEORGIA on November 11, 2022.

As a result, the number of pa- tients available for follow-up visits and assess- ment of cognitive testing was lower than ex- pected. The number of blood samples in the  biobank was also lower than expected, mainly  because of delayed initiation of sampling for the  biobank at one site. A strength of our trial is that the results were  consistent across the objective outcomes we ex- amined (death, neurologic outcomes, and labo- ratory findings). Furthermore, our sample size,  which was seven times as large as those in previ- ous trials,6,7 and the small number of patients  who did not meet screening requirements, the  consistency of the eligibility criteria with those  used in previous trials, and the double-blinded  intervention increase the generalizability of our  results and reduce the risk of bias. However, the  trial was conducted in only two high-volume  cardiac arrest centers and included a population  of patients with a high prevalence of acute coro- nary syndrome and a relatively good prognosis  based on risk factors on arrival at the hospital.  These aspects of the trial may affect the gener- alizability of our results. In this trial, targeting a mean arterial blood  pressure of 77 mm Hg as compared with 63 mm  Hg in patients who had been resuscitated after  an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest did not result in  a significant difference in the percentage of pa- tients who died or had severe disability or coma.

Tremendous progress in the management of patients with this disease has  resulted in high response rates and improved survival, yet relapse and an appropriate approach to re- treatment present continuing areas for research. The disease and its effective treatment are associated  with immunosuppression. As more patients are being treated with alternative programs, comparison of  results will require general agreement on definitions of response, relapse, and methods of determining  minimal residual disease. The development of internationally accepted, reproducible criteria is of  paramount importance in evaluating and comparing clinical trials to provide optimal care. Despite the  success achieved in managing these patients, continued participation in available clinical trials both in  the front-line and particularly in the relapse setting is highly recommended. The Hairy Cell Leukemia  Foundation convened an international conference to provide common definitions and structure to guide  current management.  There is substantial opportunity for continued research in this disease. In  addition to the importance of optimizing the prevention and management of the serious risk of  infection, organized evaluations of minimal residual disease and treatment at relapse offer ample  opportunities for clinical research.  Finally, a scholarly evaluation of quality of life in the increasing  number of survivors of this now manageable, chronic illness merits further study. The development of  consensus guidelines for this disease offers a framework for continued enhancement of the outcome for  patients.  Consensus Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Patients with Classic Hairy Cell Leukemia     Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is an uncommon chronic B-cell leukemia initially described by two independent  investigators who established this as a distinct clinical entity.1,2  While the initial term describing this  disease was leukemic reticuloendotheliosis, the cell of origin was established to be a mature B cell.3 In  2008, the WHO (World Health Organization) determined that the classic form of hairy cell leukemia  (HCLc) should be recognized as  separate from the rarer variant of this disease called hairy cell leukemia  variant (HCLv).4 The observation that a specific mutation BRAFV600E is present in the overwhelming  majority of patients with HCLc and absent in HCLv validates the clinical observation that HCLv follows a  different clinical course and response to therapy.5,6 Recently, Chung and colleagues showed that  hematopoietic stem cells from the bone marrow of patients with HCLc expressing the BRAFV600E  mutation have self-renewal potential.7 The BRAFV600E mutation was also shown to play a key role in  shaping the specific molecular signature, morphology and anti-apoptotic behavior of HCL.8 Molecular  and genomic studies identify prognostic factors in HCL that are associated to different responses to  therapy.9-13 The consistent application of these respective prognostic parameters may impact on the  optimal management of patients.

For personal use only. 4    The introduction of the purine nucleoside analogs (cladribine and pentostatin) either alone or in  combination with an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody secured durable complete responses.14-21  Nevertheless, patients relapse and require additional therapy. Substantial variability has been  introduced into how these agents are administered.22-24  Mature data regarding long-term follow-up has  shown the effectiveness of the purine analogs delivered either by continuous infusion or subcutaneous  injection (e.g. cladribine) or the intravenous administration of pentostatin. 22,25-28 As more patients are   treated with alternative programs, comparison of results will require general agreement on definitions  of response, relapse, and methods of determining minimal residual disease (MRD). The development of  internationally accepted, reproducible criteria is of paramount importance in evaluating and comparing  clinical trials.29   In an effort to clarify the approach to diagnosis, the criteria for initiating therapy, and  the selection of therapy followed by an assessment of response, the Hairy Cell Leukemia Foundation  convened an international conference to establish consensus on managing patients with HCL. In  addition, recommendations for how to approach the patient with relapse who requires re-treatment  were considered.  The unresolved but important question on how patients should best be managed with  active infection and recommendations for incorporating prophylaxis for infection were discussed.  Hopefully, the adoption of consensus guidelines will enable international experts to continue making  progress toward ever improving quality of life of patients despite the diagnosis of leukemia.  Establishing the Diagnosis   Patients often present with symptoms of fatigue and infection.1,2,30,31 While patients in the past often  presented with an enlarged spleen (approximately 90%), this finding appears to be much less frequent  due to earlier detection of disease.  More commonly patients present because of incidental findings of  pancytopenia.30,31 The initial evaluation should include careful review of the peripheral blood smear with  a differential count; monocytopenia is a relatively sensitive and specific manifestation of HCLc.   Leukemic cells are often rare.  Hairy cells are medium in size with moderately abundant pale blue  cytoplasm, reniform nuclei, open chromatin, absent nucleoli, and a characteristic serrated cytoplasmic  border (Figure 1).  In Table 1, the recommended initial work-up is presented for HCL, and other clinical  entities that may mimic this disease (e.g., HCLv; splenic marginal zone lymphoma; and splenic diffuse  red pulp small B-cell lymphoma).  The immunophenotypic profile of the leukemic cells is critical for establishing this diagnosis.   Immunophenotypic characterization of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells reveals light chain  restriction of either κ or λ expressing populations of B cells. The characteristic immunophenotype of  CD19+, CD20+, CD11c+, CD25+, CD103+, CD123+ co-expressing cells confirms the diagnostic features of  HCLc. 3,32These cells are intensely stained for CD200 expression33,34, but negatively stained for CD27  antigen. In contrast, leukemic cells in patients with the HCLv are most often negative for CD25 and  CD123, and most of these patients will not be monocytopenic.32,35  A trephine bone marrow biopsy and aspirate are important for understanding the extent of bone  marrow infiltration. At diagnosis, a successful bone marrow aspirate is often not attainable because of a  “dry tap”, since extensive fibrosis precludes the ability to obtain a cellular aspirate. Approximately 10%  of patients will also have a hypocellular bone marrow biopsy at diagnosis reflecting a decrease in normal  From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on December 6, 2016. For personal use only. 5    hematopoiesis.36  More often, the extent of bone marrow leukemic cell involvement is more accurately  assessed with immunohistochemical stains. Immunohistochemical stains for CD20, Annexin-137, and VE1  (a BRAFV600E stain) will assist in establishing the diagnosis and provide an accurate assessment of the  degree of bone marrow infiltration with leukemic cells.36,38,39  Demonstration of the BRAFV600E mutation  could also be important for those who do not respond to standard therapy or have multiple relapses.40-45   Inhibitors of BRAFV600E have provided responses in patients who have been resistant to standard  therapy.46 Consequently, it is now recommended that all patients with HCL be evaluated for this  mutation by either a sensitive molecular assay that can detect the often few (<10%) leukemic cells  present in the peripheral blood or in bone marrow aspirates diluted with blood due to "dry tap”47. It is  important to note that, in order to avoid false negative results, highly sensitive techniques (e.g., allele- specific PCR 47 or next generation sequencing) should be preferred over less sensitive ones (e.g., Sanger  sequencing, pyrosequencing or melting curve analysis). If access to sufficient leukemic cells or to highly  sensitive molecular techniques for genomic profiling is not readily achievable, then application of  immunohistochemical stain (e.g., VE1) to the bone marrow biopsy may enable detection of this  mutation 38,39.    Treatment  While the majority of patients with HCL require treatment, a small number (about 10%) may not require  immediate therapy and may be closely followed until therapy is needed.48 In general, the therapeutic  agents used to treat HCL are quite effective, but they are immunosuppressive.  Following the  administration of a purine nucleoside analog, there is a further decline in neutrophils before recovery.  Initiating therapy before the blood parameters have declined to a dangerous level or before a patient  has an active infection is advised.  Patients should be treated if they have symptoms from the disease or if the hematologic parameters are  declining. In general, the hematologic parameters indicating a need for treatment include at least one of   the following: hemoglobin < 11 g/dL; platelet count <100,000/µL; absolute neutrophil count  <1,000/µL.20,49 While these parameters serve as a guide for therapy, they indicate that bone marrow  function is  compromised and requires intervention. However, some patients with moderate  asymptomatic pancytopenia may remain progression-free for many years without therapy.  Others  present with profound pancytopenia which may be accompanied by massive splenomegaly.    Symptomatic splenomegaly may serve as an indication for treatment.  Primary nucleoside analog induction therapy for HCL involves either cladribine or pentostatin.20,49 The  administration of cladribine has been effective in several different schedules and by different routes  (e.g., intravenous continuous infusion for seven days, intravenous infusion over hours on a five-day  regimen or alternatively subcutaneously on a daily or weekly regimen). (Table 2) Subcutaneous  administration reduces cost as well as the inconvenience and side effects associated with intravenous  treatment.  Pentostatin is administered intravenously in an outpatient setting every other week to those  with near normal renal function.50  Either agent administered on one of these schedules appears to be  equally effective3,15,51 The choice is determined by physician preference or patient convenience with no  benefit to support one versus another.  From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on December 6, 2016. For personal use only. 6    Cladribine is more myelosuppressive when the entire course of therapy is administered over a week.  Pentostatin may also be myelosuppressive, but the schedule of administration enables dose titration to  reduce the depth and the duration of myelosuppression. Cladribine is not used in patients with an active  infection.  In the initial studies of this highly effective agent, patients with uncontrolled infection were  excluded52,53 .  In contrast, pentostatin has been used effectively in patients with an active infection50,54,  and reduced doses have been utilized in patients who are likely to have complications from prolonged  myelosuppression. In the absence of infection, cladribine is probably uniformly the agent that is most  often used.  Both pentostatin and cladribine are very immunosuppressive.      Cladribine is administered on a defined schedule, and is most often completed with the initial course of  treatment either as a five-day or weekly plan for six weeks or 7-day continuous intravenous infusion.  Pentostatin is administered on alternate weeks until the near normalization of hematologic parameters  and the disappearance of splenomegaly on physical examination.20,49,50,55,56 Patients should be followed  closely for evidence of fever or active infection, and routine blood counts should be obtained until  recovery.     One of the most challenging clinical situations involves the patient with HCL who requires treatment but  has an active infection.3 Attempts to control the infection should be pursued prior to instituting the  purine nucleoside analog.15,55 If it is not possible to control the infection and anti-leukemia therapy is  needed, then a decision regarding primary therapy either requires the use of a purine analog or the use  of alpha-interferon57.    Vemurafenib has been reported to be effective in patients with hairy cell  leukemia in relapse from primary purine analog therapy.  The recent observation of its ability to also  increase peripheral blood counts and thus enhance the control of infection is very encouraging, and  requires validation in clinical trials for those patients with an active infection.58     Assessment of Response   Assessment of response involves inspection of hematologic parameters, complete physical examination  including an evaluation of spleen size, and then a bone marrow biopsy to determine whether normal  hematopoiesis has been established with eradication of the leukemia. Assessment of the  “completeness” of the response may provide guidance as to the future clinical course. Patients who  have the longest disease-free interval usually have achieved a complete remission.  An assessment of  response is an important part of care. In general, it is recommended that a follow-up bone marrow  biopsy after cladribine therapy should be delayed for four to six months after completion of drug  administration.  Following purine analog therapy, there can be delayed and continuing improvement.  The bone marrow biopsy following pentostatin therapy is usually performed after a clinical response  including near normalization of hematologic parameters.  The administration of two consolidation doses  of pentostatin following completion of the induction therapy has been the general practice, but this  consolidation has not been proven to be necessary.  In patients being treated with pentostatin, failure to  obtain clinical evidence of an objective response by six months indicates that it is time to select another  therapeutic approach. In contrast, patients who show objective evidence of a response by six months  were treated up to a year in an attempt to achieve an optimal response.50  From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on December 6, 2016. For personal use only. 7    Complete Response  Accumulated data supports that achievement of a complete response is associated with longer duration  of disease free interval.14,26,27,51 While this disease is not “curable” with current therapy, patients can  achieve durable remissions that do not require continued treatment unless symptomatic relapse  occurs.59 Because the achievement of complete remission has been the “goal” of most therapeutic  investigations, it is essential that a complete response be carefully defined.49   Patients in complete response should have near normalization of peripheral blood counts: hemoglobin  >11g/dL (without transfusion), platelets >100,000/µL and an absolute neutrophil count >1,500/µL.20,49  The lymphocyte count including lymphocyte subsets may be reduced for a long period of time following  exposure to the purine analogs.60  In fact, the bone marrow may require many months before recovery  following treatment with a purine analog. Consequently, the standard hematologic parameters required  for a complete remission are accepted at values slightly lower than normal. Therefore, it is usually  recommended that an assessment for complete response following cladribine be delayed for four to six  months after treatment.20,49   There should be regression of splenomegaly by physical examination.  Notably, most studies have  required resolution of palpable splenomegaly but have not recommended treatment extension in an  effort to resolve radiographic enlargement of the spleen. While CT scans to assess completeness of  response is optional in clinical practice, these studies could be considered in the context of a clinical  trial.   For more than three decades, complete remission was defined by morphologic criteria with the  disappearance of the characteristic hairy cells from the bone marrow.  Since the demonstration that  immunohistochemical stains and flow cytometric techniques are capable of establishing that MRD is  quite evident in many patients with a normal hematoxylin and eosin stain, complete remission without  MRD is also defined. (Table 3) The criteria for defining a complete remission either with or without MRD  now includes the application of immunohistochemical stains (e.g., CD20 and DBA.44) to the bone  marrow trephine biopsy to assess presence of residual disease. The use of VE1, as a marker for leukemic  cells with the characteristic BRAFV600E, has also been reported to be helpful for measuring low volume  disease.39,61   Partial Response  A partial response is defined by near normalization of the peripheral blood counts with a minimum of  50% improvement in both organomegaly and bone marrow biopsy infiltration with HCL.   Such patients  may well remain asymptomatic for many years with no further treatment. As an alternative, Dearden  and colleagues have administered a second course of cladribine and  used rituximab in combination with  a purine analog for those not achieving an optimal response with a purine analog alone.16 Other  investigators have not opted for the second course of purine analog, but have either administered an  anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody or elected to change to an alternate purine analog in an effort to  achieve the optimal response.21,59,62 While most have acknowledged the benefit of achieving a complete  response, many have advised that complete eradication of minimal residual disease, which may  From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on December 6, 2016. For personal use only. 8    necessitate prolonged administration of immunosuppressive therapies, cannot presently be  recommended as a well-established goal of therapy.49,63,64 Recognition that the extent of remaining MRD  may impact on potential for relapse must be balanced by the extent of therapy being employed to  achieve this end. Furthermore, some hematologists reserve further attempts at intervention for those  who show either progression or persistence of symptomatic disease.  Stable Disease  Patients who have not met the criteria for an objective remission following therapy are called stable  disease.   Because patients with hairy cell leukemia are treated for specific reasons including either  symptoms or a decline in their hematologic parameters, stable disease is not an acceptable goal.   Progression of Disease  Patients who either have an increase in symptoms related to the disease or a 25% decline in their  hematologic parameters qualify for progression of disease.  Furthermore, a 25% increase in  organomegaly based upon the nadir measurements achieved following therapy also suggests  progression of disease. An effort must be made to differentiate a decline in blood counts related to the  myelosuppressive effects of chemotherapy versus progression of disease. Therapy-induced  myelosuppression usually follows treatment, and will recover with observation.  Determination of Minimal Residual Disease Following Therapy  Minimal residual disease is currently defined as HCL infiltrates recognizable by immunohistochemical  (IHC) stains, but not by conventional stains.29 Many hematopathologists estimate the percentage of cells  on the bone marrow trephine biopsy using either an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody or DBA.44.  In  patients treated with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, the use of this stain may be unpredictable.  Therefore, application of other pan B cell markers such as CD79a and/or HCL specific markers (e.g., VE1)  or DBA.44 will be required to estimate the residual presence of hairy cells that are not detectable by  regular histologic stains. One group has recommended that reliable quantitative efforts should include  specific instructions for identifying the extent of MRD.63  These efforts might also be combined with  assessing the value of serial soluble IL-2 receptor in determining the need for continuation of  therapy.65,66         The risk of relapse predicted by MRD has been grouped in one report: Group I <1% positive cells, low  risk for relapse; Group II 1 to 5% positive cells by IHC, is designated as intermediate-risk; Group III > 5%  positive cells by IHC representing a higher-risk group for relapse. The clinical value of these predictive  groups must be validated in future studies.63   While flow cytometry has been utilized to quantitate the amount of residual disease in a bone marrow  aspirate, these reports depend upon a consistent cellular yield.  In contrast, a high-quality bone marrow  biopsy provides a platform for potentially more consistent evaluation by IHC staining.  Consistency in  detection and reporting of MRD will be important given that hematologists may make treatment  From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on December 6, 2016. For personal use only. 9    decisions based upon these reports.  Long term follow-up of patients in complete response will be  required to determine the importance of MRD in the biopsy and/or aspirate.  Treatment at Relapse  The introduction of the purine analogs has markedly improved survival in this disease. Some patients  with HCL treated with purine nucleoside analogs will achieve very durable remissions lasting years  without additional therapy.26,27,67 Despite this success, many patients will require re-treatment for  relapsed disease.  In general, the first remission is more durable than subsequent remissions and is  associated with a higher percentage of complete responders. 16,68Nevertheless, achievement of a second  or greater complete remission can be accomplished with re-treatment.  Review of the previous therapy  should be included with consideration of a high-risk grouping.  If poor-risk features were identified (e.g.,  severe anemia, spleen >10 cm below the left costal margin, atypical immunophenotypic profile,  mutation of p53, IGHV4-34+ rearrangement, unmutated IGHV, absence of BRAFV600E mutation, etc),  identification of an underlying explanation for a less than desired initial response may be helpful in  deciding whether to pursue investigational therapies.3,6,12  While post-treatment bone marrow biopsies  are not mandatory outside a trial, they are required to document a complete remission (information  which carries considerable prognostic information), and is therefore quite useful even in routine  practice.  Therefore, a bone marrow biopsy is absolutely necessary to document a complete remission.  Criteria for re-treatment at relapse are equivalent to the initial criteria including symptomatic disease  (e.g. splenomegaly) or progressive anemia, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia.20,49 In general, patients  with an initial remission of < 24 months should consider alternative therapy including investigational  agents and regimens after confirming the accuracy of the original diagnosis.  Other therapeutic  approaches may still offer benefit for selected patients (e.g., alpha-interferon, rituximab, splenectomy).   Considering the success of newer agents, enrollment in a clinical trial is also an important option.  Finally, the decision of when to re-treat a patient whose disease is relapsing requires  judgment. The  mere reappearance of hairy cells either in the peripheral blood or the bone marrow by morphologic or  immunophenotypic/immunohistochemical techniques must be carefully weighed considering the  potential toxicity of immunosuppressive therapy.  The re-demonstration of leukemic cells may indicate  that a complete response has ended, but the clinical definition of relapse requiring re-treatment is  based upon recurrence of disease-related symptoms (e.g., symptomatic splenomegaly) or deterioration  in hematologic parameters (e.g., absolute neutropenia, progressive thrombocytopenia, or anemia)  equivalent to the values initially utilized for the initiation of treatment. Establishing the trend of  progressive pancytopenia is important, but good clinical judgement would indicate that attempts to re- treat should begin before these values have deteriorated to low levels.   Consideration for Investigational Approaches  Recognition of the presence of the BRAFV600E mutation led to trials showing response to small molecule  inhibitors of this target.5,46 Complete remissions have been reported utilizing the BRAF inhibitor  vemurafenib in relapse and refractory disease.42-45,69 The duration of these remissions is currently being  defined in well-designed clinical trials. However, relapse is a frequent finding, and thus strategic  From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on December 6, 2016. For personal use only. 10    combinations and/or alternative schedules of administration will need to be pursued.46 Furthermore,  newer targeted inhibitors of BRAF (e.g. Dabrafenib) also show promise in relapsed disease meriting  study in larger clinical trials.8,41,70 These agents have enabled improvement in absolute neutrophils  showing promise for patients with life-threatening infection. The role of Vemurafenib in treating  patients with hairy cell leukemia and infection deserves careful attention.58  It is important to recognize  side effects from the BRAF inhibitors that may include skin rash, arthralgias, arthritis, secondary skin  tumors that necessitate follow-up with dermatology. Rarely, vemurafenib has caused abnormal renal  function.46   Ibrutinib, a first in class oral inhibitor of the Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK), has recently been approved for  the treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell malignancies.71 This agent is currently  under study in an NCI-sponsored multi-institutional trial for patients with HCL failing to achieve optimal  response to standard therapies.   Immunotoxin conjugates have been developed at the NIH, and now are being investigated in multi- institutional clinical trials (e.g., HA-22 or moxetumomab pasudotox).72,73   Further opportunities exist to evaluate novel agents both alone or in strategic combinations.74 Because  we have prolonged the projected survival for these patients, recurrent relapse can be anticipated  meriting continued investigation.  Infection Prevention and Treatment  The most frequent cause of death among patients with HCL remains infection. Because these patients  often present with pre-existing neutropenia/monocytopenia, bacterial, viral, and opportunistic  infections can be anticipated. In addition, the primary therapy for HCL is immunosuppressive, and  patients may be placed at further risk for infection during treatment. Purine analogs confer prolonged  suppression of immune effector cells (e.g., CD4+ T cells), and induce profound and prolonged  neutropenia.75  Patients must be educated regarding infection prevention and the indications for seeking medical  treatment (e.g., fever during periods of neutropenia, rash consistent with varicella zoster). Evidence for  the use of specific prevention strategies has not been validated in well-controlled clinical trials. Practice  patterns vary between groups, and thus evaluation of both prevention and treatment strategies  represent important areas of needed research.20,49,76   The use of myeloid growth factors needs to be considered on a case-by-case basis in patients with active  infection.20 Patients may receive vaccinations that utilize killed viral agents, however there are no data  that patients with this disease respond to vaccines .  Live virus vaccines should be avoided.   Because patients with HCL who have been previously treated with purine analogs have profound and  persistent lymphopenia, they should probably receive irradiated blood products if a transfusion is  indicated to prevent transfusion-associated graft versus host disease. Furthermore, the hepatitis history  should be documented with consideration for suppressive anti-viral treatment for those who are HepB  From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on December 6, 2016.

Therefore, screening for previous exposure to  hepatitis before therapy for the disease is highly recommended.77   Summary  Enormous progress in the management of HCL has resulted in prolonged survival in many patients.  HCL  cannot be cured with standard chemo-immunotherapy.  Patients remain at risk for relapse over time.  Because of the tremendous success of standard therapy, many patients are now treated outside of a  clinical trial with increasing variability in disease management and monitoring. The Hairy Cell Leukemia  Foundation convened an international conference to provide common definitions and structure to guide  current management.    The development of consensus guidelines for this rare disease offers a  framework for continued improvement of the outcome for these patients.  Patients should be encouraged to follow normal recommendations for cancer screening including  routine careful follow-up with a dermatologist. Studies in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia  (CLL) show that an immune response to vaccinations is limited78.  Because infection is a leading cause of  morbidity and mortality in both CLL and HCL, further investigation of the effectiveness of vaccination  strategies to prevent illness is warranted.  The development of these consensus guidelines is intended to  improve the care of patients with this uncommon hematologic malignancy by addressing the most  common complications. Patients with HCLc can also have many unusual manifestations of the disease.  The guidelines are intended to enhance care of patients, and should not be utilized to deny appropriate  and necessary diagnostic or therapeutic interventions.

Partial Remission   � A partial response requires near normalization of the peripheral blood count  (as in CR) with a  minimum of 50% improvement in both the organomegaly and bone marrow biopsy infiltration  with hairy cell leukemia.  Stable Disease   � Patients who have not met the criteria for an objective remission following therapy are called  stable disease. Because patients with hairy cell leukemia are treated for specific reasons  including either disease-related symptoms or decline in their hematologic parameters, stable  disease is not an acceptable response.  Progression of Disease   � Patients who have either an increase in symptoms related to disease, or a 25% increase in  organomegaly ,or a 25% decline in their hematologic parameters qualify for progression of  disease. An effort must be made to differentiate a decline in blood counts related to  myelosuppression effects of therapy versus progression of disease.    Hairy Cell Leukemia in Relapse  � Morphological relapse is defined as the reappearance of hairy cell leukemia in either the  peripheral blood or the bone marrow biopsy or both by morphological stains, in the absence of  hematological relapse.  Hematological relapse is defined as reappearance of cytopenia(s) below  the thresholds defined above for complete and partial response. Whereas no treatment is  necessarily needed in case of morphological relapse, treatment decisions for a hematological  relapse are based upon several parameters (e.g., hematologic parameters warranting  intervention; reoccurrence of disease-related symptoms)                     From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on December 6, 2016.

Treatment with canakinumab,  a monoclonal antibody that inhibits inflammation by neutralizing interleukin-1β,  resulted in a lower rate of cardiovascular events than placebo in a previous ran- domized trial. We sought to determine whether an alternative approach to inflam- mation inhibition with low-dose methotrexate might provide similar benefit. METHODS We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial of low-dose methotrexate (at a  target dose of 15 to 20 mg weekly) or matching placebo in 4786 patients with  previous myocardial infarction or multivessel coronary disease who additionally  had either type 2 diabetes or the metabolic syndrome. All participants received 1 mg  of folate daily. The primary end point at the onset of the trial was a composite of  nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death. Near the  conclusion of the trial, but before unblinding, hospitalization for unstable angina  that led to urgent revascularization was added to the primary end point. RESULTS The trial was stopped after a median follow-up of 2.3 years. Methotrexate did not  result in lower interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, or C-reactive protein levels than pla- cebo. The final primary end point occurred in 201 patients in the methotrexate  group and in 207 in the placebo group (incidence rate, 4.13 vs. 4.31 per 100 per- son-years; hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79 to 1.16). The  original primary end point occurred in 170 patients in the methotrexate group and  in 167 in the placebo group (incidence rate, 3.46 vs. 3.43 per 100 person-years;  hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.25). Methotrexate was associated with eleva- tions in liver-enzyme levels, reductions in leukocyte counts and hematocrit levels,  and a higher incidence of non–basal-cell skin cancers than placebo. CONCLUSIONS Among patients with stable atherosclerosis, low-dose methotrexate did not reduce  levels of interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, or C-reactive protein and did not result in  fewer cardiovascular events than placebo.

These results thus provide proof of principle that  inhibiting inflammation can prevent atheroscle- rotic events.6-8 We hypothesized that an alternative approach  to inhibition of inflammation that involved the  use of low-dose methotrexate might also result  in lower cardiovascular event rates. Low-dose  methotrexate is an inexpensive, effective, and  widely used treatment for inflammatory condi- tions, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic  arthritis, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis.9,10 Fur- thermore, in observational studies, patients with  rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis who  received low-dose methotrexate had fewer cardio- vascular events than patients who received other  therapies or placebo.11-13 We report here the re- sults of the Cardiovascular Inflammation Reduc- tion Trial (CIRT), which was conducted in collabo- ration with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood  Institute (NHLBI) and was planned in parallel  with CANTOS. In CIRT, we assessed low-dose  methotrexate in the secondary prevention of  atherothrombotic events among patients with a  history of myocardial infarction or multivessel  coronary artery disease who additionally had ei- ther type 2 diabetes or the metabolic syndrome.14 Methods Trial Design and Oversight This randomized, double-blind, placebo-con- trolled, investigator-initiated trial was funded by  the NHLBI. The trial protocol, available with the  full text of this article at NEJM.org, was de- signed by the trial executive committee with  input from NHLBI staff and an NHLBI-appointed  protocol-review committee, the members of which  subsequently served as the trial data and safety  monitoring board. The protocol was approved by  the institutional review board at each of the 417  centers in North America that participated in the  trial (Section A in the Supplementary Appendix,  available at NEJM.org). All trial functions — including data collection,  adjustment of doses of methotrexate and placebo,  site monitoring, end-point adjudication, and sta- tistical support — were performed at the Center  for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention at Brigham  and Women’s Hospital in Boston, with the use  of a single, multipurpose central electronic data- capture system (e-SOCDAT, SOCAR Research).  The trial drug (Trexall in 5-mg tablets) and  matching placebo were purchased from Teva  Pharmaceuticals, which was responsible for the  manufacturing, packaging, and distribution; Teva  Pharmaceuticals donated the costs for packag- ing and shipping but had no role in the design  or conduct of the trial. The first and last authors  prepared the first draft of the manuscript, had  full access to the trial databases, generated trial  analyses, made the decision to submit the manu- script for publication, and assume responsibility  for the accuracy and completeness of the data  and analyses and for the fidelity of the trial to  the protocol. Trial Population Patients 18 years of age or older were eligible if  they had a history of myocardial infarction or  multivessel coronary disease and either type 2  diabetes or the metabolic syndrome. Eligible pa- tients were in a medically stable condition and  had completed any planned revascularization pro- cedures. The trial inclusion and exclusion crite- ria were similar to or were more restrictive than  those in the guidelines for use of methotrexate  in patients with rheumatoid arthritis published  by the American College of Rheumatology.15  Patients with a history of chronic infection, tuber- culosis, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fi- brosis, alcohol abuse, hepatic or renal dysfunc- tion, or New York Heart Association class IV heart  failure were excluded, as were women of child- bearing potential and patients who were receiving  treatment with oral glucocorticoids or other im- munosuppressive agents.

Once this process was completed,  participants entered an open-label run-in phase  lasting 5 to 8 weeks during which they received  1 mg of oral folic acid daily, along with oral  methotrexate once weekly in doses increasing  sequentially from 5 mg to 10 mg to 15 mg. Par- ticipants who had adverse effects or laboratory  abnormalities during the run-in phase were ex- cluded from further participation (Section B and  Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Participants who successfully completed the  trial run-in — with success defined as their hav- ing taken 15 mg of methotrexate once weekly for  at least 2 consecutive weeks without adverse ef- fects or laboratory abnormalities — were then  randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio, by means of a  computer algorithm, to continue methotrexate,  initially at a dose of 15 mg, or to receive placebo  (Section C in the Supplementary Appendix). All  participants continued taking folate daily. Ran- domization was stratified according to site, type  of index event (multivessel coronary disease alone  or myocardial infarction), time since the index  event (≥6 months or <6 months), and status with  respect to risk factors (the metabolic syndrome  alone or diabetes). At 4 months, the dose was  increased, per protocol, to 20 mg of methotrex- ate (or matching placebo). A computerized algo- rithm (based on levels of centrally measured labo- ratory variables and reported symptoms, assessed  every 2 months, with treatment assignments  concealed) was used to adjust the dose of meth- otrexate or placebo in a standardized manner at  all sites (Section D and Figs. S2 and S3 in the  Supplementary Appendix). End Points At trial initiation on April 4, 2013, the primary  end point was the first occurrence of a major  adverse cardiovascular event (a composite of non- fatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or  cardiovascular death). On January 24, 2018, after  review by the NHLBI and an independent exter- nal panel, the trial end point was expanded to  include hospitalization for unstable angina that  led to urgent coronary revascularization; this end  point would provide greater power and allow for  a smaller overall sample size. Other than the  members of the data coordinating center, who  had access to unblinded data and had no role in  this decision, no members of the investigative  team or the independent external panel were  aware of any unblinded trial data at the time of  this decision. Secondary end points included death from  any cause; a composite of major adverse cardio- vascular events plus any coronary revasculariza- tion; hospitalization for congestive heart failure;  and a composite of major adverse cardiovascular  events plus coronary revascularization, hospital- ization for congestive heart failure, or death  from any cause. Tertiary end points included the  components of the final primary end point as  well as coronary revascularization and arterial  revascularization. Statistical Analysis The initial sample-size calculation, which was  determined on the basis of the original primary  end point of major adverse cardiovascular events,  was revised after the addition of hospitalization  for unstable angina that led to urgent revascu- larization. The anticipated trial sample size was  reduced from 7000 to 5500, and the targeted  number of primary end-point events (including  the expanded definition) was increased from  530 to 634 to give the trial 90% power to detect  a 23% lower rate of the primary end point in the  methotrexate group than the placebo group.  However, before these changes could be fully  implemented across trial operations, the data  and safety monitoring board, at a meeting on  March 13, 2018, recommended early termina- tion of the trial because it had crossed a pre- specified boundary for futility for both the  original and final end points and because of the  lack of evidence of a reduction in C-reactive pro- tein level with methotrexate treatment. The data  and safety monitoring board further requested  that all participants return for a safety follow-up  visit after an additional 6 months of follow-up.  These recommendations were accepted by the  NHLBI on April 2, 2018, at which time both  enrollment and efficacy follow-up ceased. In this  article, we report the original and final primary  end points. The trial protocol provides details of the pre- specified statistical analysis plan.

Log-rank tests  and Cox proportional-hazards models, stratified  according to type of index event, time of index  event, and status with respect to the metabolic  syndrome alone or diabetes at enrollment, were  used to analyze both the original and final pri- mary end points, according to the intention-to- treat principle. For secondary and tertiary end  points, results are reported as point estimates  and 95% confidence intervals. The 95% confi- dence intervals have not been adjusted for mul- tiplicity, and therefore inferences drawn from  these intervals may not be reproducible. Results Patients Of 9321 potential participants who provided in- formed consent and attended a screening visit,  6158 were eligible and were enrolled in the open- label run-in phase. At the time the trial was  terminated, 4786 of the 6158 eligible patients  had completed the run-in phase and had been  randomly assigned to either low-dose metho- trexate (2391 patients) or placebo (2395 patients)  (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). The  median age of the patients was 66 years, 19%  were women, and 22% identified themselves as  nonwhite or Hispanic (Table 1). The qualifying  event for trial participation was a previous myo- cardial infarction in 61% of the patients and  multivessel coronary disease without previous  infarction in 39%. Qualifying coexisting condi- tions were diabetes in 68% and the metabolic  syndrome without diabetes in 32%. Data from a  small cluster of sites with major Good Clinical  Practice violations are not included in the analy- ses reported here, a decision that was made be- fore the data were unblinded (Section E in the  Supplementary Appendix). Laboratory Findings During the open-label run-in phase, initiation of  low-dose methotrexate was associated with in- creases in serum levels of alanine aminotransfer- ase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)  and decreases in white-cell counts. Methotrexate  did not reduce high-sensitivity C-reactive protein  levels during the run-in phase (Table S1 in the  Supplementary Appendix). At randomization, the  median level of high-sensitivity C-reactive pro- tein was 1.6 mg per liter, and the median low- density lipoprotein cholesterol level was 67 mg  per deciliter (1.73 mmol per liter). At 8 months after randomization, patients  assigned to receive methotrexate had significantly  greater increases from baseline in median levels  of ALT and AST and in mean corpuscular volume  than patients assigned to placebo and signifi- cantly greater reductions from baseline in the  total white-cell count, hematocrit level, and hemo- globin level (P<0.001 for all comparisons be- tween the methotrexate group and the placebo  group). At 8 months, treatment with low-dose  methotrexate did not result in greater reductions  from baseline than placebo in levels of C-reactive  protein, interleukin-1β, or interleukin-6. Long- term methotrexate treatment did not alter C-reac- tive protein levels, which were measured annually  throughout the trial (Fig. 1, and Table S2 and Fig.  S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). Follow-up and Effects on Clinical End Points During the trial, the computerized dosing algo- rithm directed adjustments to doses at 21% of  the trial visits of patients in the methotrexate  group and at 18% of the visits of patients in the  placebo group. Among patients who were still  taking the assigned methotrexate or placebo at  their last visit before trial completion, the mean  weekly dose was 18.8 mg in the methotrexate  group and 19.0 mg in the placebo group. At the  final visit before the trial was stopped, 21% of  the patients in the methotrexate group and 22%  in the placebo group had permanently discon- tinued the trial regimen. After a median follow-up of 2.3 years (maxi- mum, 5 years), a first occurrence after random- ization of a final primary end-point event (non- fatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke,  cardiovascular death, or hospitalization for un- stable angina that led to urgent revascularization)  was reported in 201 patients in the methotrexate  group and in 207 in the placebo group (inci- dence rate, 4.13 vs. 4.31 per 100 person-years;  hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI],  0.79 to 1.16; P = 0.67) (Table 2 and Fig. 2).

A total of 96 deaths from any cause  occurred in the methotrexate group, and 83 oc- curred in the placebo group (incidence rate, 1.80  vs. 1.55 per 100 person-years; hazard ratio, 1.16;  95% CI, 0.87 to 1.56). We observed no effect  modification in subgroup analyses stratified ac- cording to type of index event, time since index  event, status with respect to diabetes or the  metabolic syndrome at the time of enrollment,  time spent enrolled in the trial, or levels of base- line high-sensitivity C-reactive protein above or  below the trial median (data not shown). Adverse Events Rates of serious adverse events, including bleed- ing and infection, were similar in the two groups  (Table 3). Mouth sores and oral pain were more  prevalent in the methotrexate group than in the  placebo group, as was unintended weight loss.  Modest leukopenia and elevations of ALT and  AST levels were also more common in the  methotrexate group. Cancers developed in more  patients in the methotrexate group than in the  placebo group (52 vs. 30; rate ratio, 1.72; P = 0.02),  an effect that was due almost entirely to a larger  number of patients with non–basal-cell skin  cancer in the methotrexate group (31 vs. 10; rate  ratio, 3.08; P = 0.002).

Methotrexate was as- sociated with modest elevations in liver enzyme  levels and reductions in leukocyte counts and  hematocrit levels, as well as a higher incidence  of non–basal-cell skin cancers than placebo.  There was no difference between the groups in  all-cause mortality. Because the findings for low-dose methotrex- ate in CIRT contrast with those for canakinumab  in CANTOS,3 a comparison of these two contem- porary trials, which were designed and con- ducted in parallel, is informative. Both CIRT and  CANTOS enrolled patients with atherosclerosis  who were in stable condition but at high risk  and who received aggressive treatment with lipid- lowering therapies. CANTOS, however, by design,  included patients with residual inflammatory  risk16 and thus limited enrollment to patients  with persistently elevated high-sensitivity C-reac- tive protein levels; this trial design resulted in a  median baseline C-reactive protein level among  participants of 4.2 mg per liter (the approximate  90th percentile of the normal distribution). By  contrast, CIRT did not screen for C-reactive pro- tein level but instead required participants to have  either diabetes or the metabolic syndrome. This  trial design resulted in a median high-sensitivity  C-reactive protein level of only 1.6 mg per liter at  randomization. In addition, in CANTOS, the reduction from  baseline in interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein  levels was 35 to 40 percentage points greater in  the group assigned to receive canakinumab than  in the group assigned to receive placebo,3-5 where- as in CIRT, methotrexate did not lower either of  these inflammatory biomarkers or interleukin-1β.  Thus, although abundant data indicate that in- flammation contributes critically to atherothrom- bosis,1-3 an important provisional hypothesis de- riving from these two contemporary trials is that  reducing the risk of cardiovascular events may  depend on the pathway targeted. Inhibition of  interleukin-1β–interleukin-6 signaling, a process  initiated at the level of the NLRP3 inflamma- some,17 effectively reduced cardiovascular events  in CANTOS, and human genetic data implicate  this pathway as causal in atherothrombosis. Stud- ies with neutral outcomes involving other anti- inflammatory agents (e.g., the phospholipase in- hibitor darapladib and the p38 MAP kinase blocker  losmapimod)18,19 that also did not lower levels of  interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, or C-reactive pro- tein over the long term point to pathways that  appear to be less critical in atherothrombosis.

Agents such  as colchicine and oral NLRP3 inhibitors that may  also intersect with this pathway are currently  under investigation or in development.23 The data reported here raise several additional  issues. Before the initiation of CIRT, observa- tional data had repeatedly shown an association  of low-dose methotrexate use with reduced vas- cular event rates in patients with rheumatoid  arthritis or psoriatic arthritis.11-13 The reported  benefits in these observational studies may apply  only to patients with existing systemic inflamma- tory conditions, but it is also possible that un- measured confounding arising from the selective  use of methotrexate led to bias in the estimates.  Similarly, although there is evidence that metho- trexate administered to treat rheumatoid arthri- tis lowers the C-reactive protein level, data show- ing this effect derive almost exclusively from  studies that enrolled individuals with inflamma- tory disease flares. It is thus possible that the  ability of methotrexate to reduce the C-reactive  protein level is limited to clinical situations in  which inflammation levels are high. Some of the  reported reduction in the C-reactive protein level  in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or resistant  juvenile arthritis might have resulted from re- gression to the mean. Finally, in this trial,  methotrexate resulted in more cases of non– basal-cell skin cancers than placebo, a finding  that was unexpected and that merits further  exploration.24-26 In summary, in this randomized, placebo- controlled trial involving patients with stable  atherosclerosis, low-dose methotrexate did not  reduce levels of interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, or  C-reactive protein and did not result in fewer  cardiovascular events than placebo.

Increasingly, these biological insights are  pointing the way towards novel therapeutic approaches. Using representative clinical  case presentations, we review the key clinical, pathologic and epidemiologic features of  infant leukemia, including the high frequency of KMT2A gene rearrangements. We  describe the current approach to risk stratified treatment of infant leukemia in the major  international cooperative groups. We highlight recent discoveries that elucidate the  molecular biology of infant leukemia and suggest novel targeted therapeutic strategies,  including modulation of aberrant epigenetic programs, inhibition of signaling pathways,  and immunotherapeutics. Finally, we underscore the need for increased global  collaboration  to  translate  these  discoveries  into  improved  outcomes. From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on November 21, 2018.

Physical examination revealed hepatosplenomegaly, pallor and petechiae.  Laboratory examination showed striking leukocytosis [white blood cells (WBC) 1,100 x  109/L], anemia [hemoglobin (Hb) 3.1 g/dL] and thrombocytopenia [platelets (PLT) 10 x  109/L]. Bone marrow examination showed 98% blast cells with a very immature B-cell  phenotype (CD19+, CD10-, cytoplasmic Ig-, CD20-) and a KMT2A-MLLT1 gene fusion  (Table 2). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showed WBC 38 per microliter, and  cytospin showed lymphoblasts morphologically. He was enrolled on the Interfant-06  protocol (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00550992). During induction (Figure 1), he had febrile  neutropenia and received broad spectrum empiric antibiotics. He achieved  morphological remission after induction.   Patient 2:     A 4 month old boy was admitted to the hospital because he was not feeding well and  had pale gray skin. Physical examination revealed pallor and hepatosplenomegaly.  Laboratory examination showed leukocytosis (WBC 250 x 109/L), anemia (Hb 5.5 g/dL)  and thrombocytopenia (PLT 28 x 109/L). Bone marrow examination showed 99% blast  cells with very immature B-cell phenotype (CD19+, CD10-, cytoplasmic Ig-, CD20-) and  a KMT2A-AFF1 gene fusion.

Patient 3:     A 10 month old girl was admitted to the hospital with irritability, fever, poor appetite and  rash. Physical examination revealed petechiae, pallor and tenderness to palpation of  the extremities. Laboratory examination showed leukopenia and neutropenia (WBC 1.2  x 109/L with 30% neutrophils), anemia (Hb 6.7 g/dL) and thrombocytopenia (PLT 47 x  109/L). Bone marrow examination showed 99% blast cells with immature B-cell  phenotype (CD19+, CD10+, cytoplasmic Ig-, CD20-) and normal cytogenetics. CSF  examination showed WBC 1 per microliter, and cytospin showed no lymphoblasts  morphologically. She was enrolled on the Interfant-06 protocol. She had no significant  complications during induction, and achieved morphological remission after induction.   Patient 4:     A 7 month old girl was admitted to the hospital with a progressive rash, fever and poor  feeding. Physical examination revealed scattered palpable blue cutaneous nodules and  hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory examination showed leukocytosis (WBC 42 x 109/L),  anemia (Hb 5.9 g/dL) and thrombocytopenia (PLT 28 x 109/L).

Patient 5:     A 4 month old boy was admitted with poor feeding, pale skin and enlarging abdomen.  Physical examination revealed pallor and hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory examination  showed leukopenia and neutropenia (WBC 2.1 x 109/L with 25% neutrophils), anemia  (Hb 5.4 g/dL) and thrombocytopenia (PLT 56 x 109/L). Bone marrow was difficult to  aspirate, but sufficient material was obtained for flow cytometry, showing 23% blast  cells with a megakaryoblastic phenotype (MPO-, CD41a+, CD61+) and RBM15-MKL1  fusion. Bone marrow biopsy showed striking fibrosis. CSF examination showed WBC 0  per microliter, and cytospin showed no blasts morphologically. He was enrolled on the  COG AAML1031 protocol. During induction he developed a presumed fungal pneumonia  (nodular infiltrates on CT with a positive serum galactomannan) that resolved with liposomal  amphotericin B. The end induction bone marrow showed 15% residual megakaryoblasts.   Patient 6:   A 7 month old girl was admitted to the hospital because of a worsening rash, fever and  poor feeding. Physical examination revealed petechiae, pallor and diffuse adenopathy.  Laboratory examination showed leukocytosis (WBC 95 x 109/L), anemia (Hb 6.5 g/dL)  and thrombocytopenia (PLT 14 x 109/L). Bone marrow examination showed 94% blast  cells with two discrete populations of blasts: about 60% of the blasts had an immature  B-cell phenotype (CD19+, CD10-, cytoplasmic Ig-, CD20-) and about 40% had a  monoblastic phenotype (MPO+, CD34-, HLA-DR+, CD33+, CD11b+). In addition, a  KMT2A-MLLT10 gene fusion was detected. CSF examination showed WBC 13 per  microliter, and cytospin showed heterogeneous blasts morphologically.

Discussion (Part 1)    Definition and Epidemiology  “Infant leukemia” refers to acute leukemia diagnosed prior to one year of age.  Fortunately, infant leukemia is rare, with estimated incidence of 41 cases per million in  the United States (US), which equates to approximately 160 cases of infant leukemia  per year. Within the infant age group, neuroblastoma, brain tumors and acute leukemia  all occur with similar frequency. There is a slight predominance of lymphoid over  myeloid cases within infant leukemia, and of the lymphoid cases, nearly all are B- lineage with less than 5% T-lineage. The incidence of ALL in infants is lower than in  children aged 1-14 years old and approximately the same as the incidence of ALL in  adolescents. In contrast, the incidence of AML in infants is about twice that of the  incidence of AML in older children and adolescents. Interestingly, infant leukemia  demonstrates a female predominance, in contrast to the male predominance in  leukemia diagnosed beyond the first birthday.1  Clinical Features  Compared with older children, infants with acute leukemia tend to present with  more aggressive features, including high white blood cell counts (WBC),  hepatosplenomegaly, central nervous system (CNS) involvement and leukemia cutis  (skin infiltration).2, 3   Prognosis  From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on November 21, 2018. For personal use only. 7    The prognostic significance of infant age differs between ALL and AML. In ALL,  infants fare far worse than older children. The 4 year event free survival (EFS) in  Interfant-99, the largest trial of infant ALL to date, was 47%.4 Recent trials for childhood  ALL report long term EFS rates exceeding 85%.5, 6 In AML, outcomes for infants are  similar to those for older children.3   KMT2A (formerly MLL) gene rearrangements  A high proportion of infant leukemias are characterized cytogenetically by  balanced chromosomal translocations involving the histone lysine methyltransferase 2A  gene [KMT2A, formerly known as mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene] at chromosome  11q23. KMT2A rearrangements (KMT2A-r) occur in about 5% of childhood ALL cases  overall,7 but in 70-80% of ALL in infants.2, 4 In childhood AML, KMT2A-r is more  common overall (15-20%), but is also particularly common in the infant age group  (about 50%).8  KMT2A-r results in the fusion of the N-terminus of the KMT2A gene with the C- terminus of a partner gene. Remarkably, 94 different KMT2A partner genes have now  been identified.9 In infant ALL, four partner genes account for 93% of cases: AFF1  (formerly AF4; 49%), MLLT1 (formerly ENL, 22%), MLLT3 (formerly AF9, 17%), and  MLLT10 (formerly AF10, 5%). In infant AML, three partner genes account for 66% of  cases: MLLT3 (22%), MLLT10 (27%), and ELL (17%).  Various lines of evidence (retrospective analyses of neonatal samples10 and twin  concordance studies,11 for example) have shown that KMT2A rearrangements are  acquired in hematopoietic precursors in utero, and, compared to other oncogenic  fusions such as ETV6-RUNX1, initiate a strikingly rapid progression to leukemia. One  From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on November 21, 2018. For personal use only. 8    intriguing aspect of leukemia epidemiology is that KMT2A-r leukemias occur with high  frequency in two very different clinical situations: 1) infants with de novo acute leukemia,  and 2) patients with treatment-related secondary myelodysplastic syndrome/AML (t- MDS/AML) after exposure to potent DNA topoisomerase II (DNAt2) inhibitors  (etoposide, e.g.). This has led to a hypothesis, with supporting evidence from case- control12, 13 and laboratory14 studies, that maternal exposure to environmental DNAt2  inhibitors (dietary flavonoids, e.g.) during pregnancy may contribute to the risk of  KMT2A-r infant leukemia. Germline genetic susceptibility may also play a role, as  candidate gene studies15, 16 and genome-wide association studies (GWAS)17,18 have  identified a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that correlate with risk of  infant leukemia.   In ALL, KMT2A-r is associated with CD10 negativity and coexpression of one or  more myeloid antigens, suggesting that these leukemias arise from very immature  lymphoid progenitors.19 In AML, KMT2A-r is associated with monocytic differentiation.3  Infant leukemia cases can be of ambiguous lineage, either due to a mixed phenotype  (MPAL, as shown in Patient 6) or to lack of differentiation markers (acute  undifferentiated leukemia, AUL).   KMT2A-r has different prognostic implications in infant ALL than infant AML. In  infant ALL, KMT2A-r is clearly associated with poorer outcome. In the Children’s Cancer  Group protocol CCG-1953, 5 year EFS for KMT2A-r infants was 34% vs. 60% with  germline (wild type) KMT2A (wt-KMT2A).2 In Interfant-99, 4 year EFS in KMT2A-r and  wt-KMT2A infants was 37% and 74%, respectively.4 In infant AML, KMT2A-r is not a  significant risk factor. In a combined analysis of AML-BFM-98 and -2004, the 5 year  From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on November 21, 2018. For personal use only. 9    EFS was 43% and 52% for KMT2A-r and wt-KMT2A infants, respectively (p=0.59).3  There is, however, evidence in pediatric AML generally that within KMT2A-r cases,  certain KMT2A fusion partners may be associated with favorable (e.g., MLLT11) or  unfavorable (e.g., MLLT10) prognosis, and there are plans to incorporate these into  future pediatric AML risk stratification algorithms.20, 21  Among infants with KMT2A-r ALL, additional independent prognostic factors  include age and WBC at diagnosis, with the younger infants and those with the higher  WBC having poorer outcomes.2, 4, 22 In the context of a 7-day “prophase” of single agent  prednisone given prior to intensive induction chemotherapy in the Interfant-99 protocol,  a poor response (greater than or equal to 1,000 blasts per microliter in the peripheral  blood on day 8) was also an independent negative prognostic factor.4   Induction therapy and risk stratification – Infant AML  Given the similar prognosis and response to therapy of infants with AML  compared to older children, infants are generally treated on the same clinical trial  protocols as older children, which typically include intensive multiagent chemotherapy to  induce remission followed by consolidation with either additional chemotherapy courses  (for patients with favorable prognostic features) or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell  transplantation (for patients with unfavorable prognostic features). Gemtuzumab is likely  to be added to chemotherapy in future protocols based on favorable results, both in  pediatrics overall23 and infants specifically.24 Cases of AML in infants are relatively  unlikely to harbor cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities that confer unfavorable risk or  favorable risk, and risk stratification is typically dictated by end-induction minimal  From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on November 21, 2018.

One notable exception to this, however, is illustrated in Patient 5. Among  pediatric cases of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL), the vast majority occur in  patients with Down syndrome (constitutional trisomy 21), typically characterized by  presentation at age 2-4 years, a history of transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) in  the newborn period, and a favorable prognosis.25 When AMKL occurs in children  without Down syndrome, on the other hand, the patient is nearly always an infant. A  variety of oncogenic fusions, of which the first to be described was the RBM15-MKL1  fusion resulting from the reciprocal translocation t(1;22)(p13;q13), drive this rare subset  of infant leukemia. The prognosis is generally unfavorable due to a high risk of  chemotherapy resistance and relapse, although outcomes do vary according to the  specific oncogenic fusion.26  Induction therapy and risk stratification – Infant ALL  Treatment for infant ALL is quite different than that for childhood ALL generally.  There are three major cooperative groups conducting specific clinical trials for infant  ALL: Interfant (based in Europe), COG (based in North America), and the Japanese  Pediatric Leukemia Study Group (JPLSG). All have adopted an identical induction  strategy based on Interfant-99 (Figure 1).4 Until recently, COG trials used a more  intensive induction regimen, but this was abandoned in favor of the Interfant induction  due to excessive toxicity.27 In recently completed trials, all used a prospective risk- stratified approach that incorporates KMT2A-r status and age (Table 3).   From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on November 21, 2018. For personal use only. 11    Among infant ALL patients, wt-KMT2A patients are considered low risk, and have  favorable clinical features (lower WBC, older age at presentation, e.g.). However, the  outcome of wt-KMT2A infants is clearly inferior to ALL patients diagnosed after 1 year of  age. This is likely due, in part, to differences in distribution of favorable genetic features,  as infants with wt-KMT2A ALL are much less likely to harbor the favorable genetic  features high hyperdiploidy and ETV6–RUNX1 fusions compared to older children.28, 29.  Moving forward, wt-KMT2A infant ALL patients are likely to be treated on general  frontline ALL protocols, and therefore subject to the same risk group stratification  strategies, including the prospective use of MRD monitoring.  Induction therapy complications  The infant patient’s unique vulnerability to complications and toxicities presents a  challenge in treating infant acute leukemia. There are limited data to guide how the  distinct and rapidly changing physiology of infants (in terms of body composition,  binding of drugs by plasma proteins, cytochrome p450 activity, renal function,  immunocompetence, etc.) should be considered in designing chemotherapy treatment  protocols. The data that do exist differ by chemotherapy drug. For example, no age  dependency was found for the pharmacokinetics of daunorubicin30 while the systemic  clearance rate of MTX tended to increase with age during infancy.31 Infant leukemia  protocols have encountered problems with excessive toxicity, both in ALL27 and AML.32  Survivors of infant leukemia also demonstrate an increased risk of late effects,  particularly in cases where treatment included cranial radiation or hematopoietic stem  cell transplantation (HSCT).25  Case Studies, Continued (Table 1)     From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on November 21, 2018. For personal use only. 12    Patient 1:   Post induction, he was randomized to receive consolidation with multiagent  chemotherapy blocks Protocol IB and MARMA. His minimal residual disease (MRD)  level post-MARMA was <10e-4 (0.01%) by PCR. He received allogeneic HSCT in first  remission with an umbilical cord blood (UCB) donor after a preparatory regimen with  busulfan, cyclosphosphamide and melphalan. He relapsed 7 months after HSCT. His  leukemia was refractory to several attempts at reinduction with various multiagent  salvage chemotherapy regimens and he died of overwhelming sepsis and multiorgan  failure at age 17 months.  Patient 2:   Post-induction, he was randomized to receive consolidation with multiagent  chemotherapy blocks (Reinduction, Consolidation, Continuation) without the FLT3  inhibitor lestaurtinib, followed by maintenance therapy for a total duration of 2 years. He  is now 5 years after initial diagnosis and remains in complete remission.   Patient 3:   Post-induction, she received multiagent chemotherapy blocks Protocol IB, MARMA and  OCTADAD, followed by maintenance for a total duration of 2 years. She is now 7 years  after initial diagnosis and remains in complete remission.   Patient 4:   Post-induction, she received 3 additional blocks of intensive multiagent chemotherapy.  During recovery from the 3rd and final post-induction block, she developed a rash that  was biopsied and shown to represent relapsed leukemia cutis. Bone marrow and CSF  also revealed recurrent disease (8% blasts in the bone marrow, WBC 7 per microliter in  From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on November 21, 2018.

She achieved a second  remission and proceeded to allogeneic HSCT with an HLA-haploidentical bone marrow  donor after a preparatory regimen with busulfan and cyclophosphamide. She is now 2  years post-HSCT and remains in second remission.  Patient 5:   Since he was refractory to induction therapy, he received a salvage chemotherapy  regimen with mitoxantrone and high dose cytarabine. He achieved a morphologic  remission, but still had scattered detectable megakaryoblasts by morphology and 3%  megakaryoblasts by flow cytometry. He received allogeneic HSCT with an UCB donor  after a preparatory regimen with busulfan, cyclosphosphamide and melphalan. He died  of multiorgan failure in the setting of progressive fungal infection 4 months after HSCT.  At autopsy, residual leukemia was seen in the bone marrow.  Patient 6:   Post-induction, flow cytometry revealed a residual population of 2.8% in the bone  marrow that expressed the same monoblastic phenotype (MPO+, CD34-, HLA-DR+,  CD33+, CD11b+) that was detected as the minority population at diagnosis. She  received a second round of induction therapy with ADE (cytarabine, daunorubicin and  etoposide), complicated by Streptococcus viridans sepsis. She recovered and was in  complete remission with negative flow cytometry. She received allogeneic HSCT with  an HLA-identical sibling bone marrow donor after a preparatory regimen with busulfan  and cyclosphosphamide. She remains in remission 3 years after HSCT.  Discussion (Part 2)    From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on November 21, 2018. For personal use only. 14    Post-induction Therapy for Infant Leukemia  Post-induction management of infant leukemia is heterogeneous. Table 4  summarizes the post-induction treatment approaches for infant ALL by the major  cooperative groups (see also, Table 3). Interfant-06 tested whether consolidation with  “myeloid”-style chemotherapy with cytarabine, daunorubicin, mitoxantrone and  etoposide is superior to “lymphoid”-style consolidation with cyclophosphamide,  cytarabine and 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) in KMT2A-r infants. This stems from the  hypothesis that these leukemias derive from an early hematopoietic precursor with  myeloid differentiation potential and may therefore respond better to chemotherapy  regimens developed for AML. AALL0631 tested whether the addition of a FLT3 tyrosine  kinase inhibitor (lestaurtinib) to post-induction chemotherapy will enhance the  effectiveness of chemotherapy, based on data showing aberrant activation of the FLT3  pathway in KMT2A-r ALL. Given the similarities in treatment approach and outcomes  between the groups and the rarity of infant ALL, the three groups are currently  developing a joint collaborative protocol to standardize treatment and enhance the  ability to test novel treatment approaches based on recent discoveries regarding the  unique molecular biology of KMT2A-r leukemias and ongoing pilot trials within the  groups (detailed in subsequent sections).  Post-induction treatment for infant AML is typically the same as for older children  with AML. Patient 6 demonstrates a typical induction and post-induction course for an  infant with MPAL. The decision of whether to proceed with induction treatment following  an ALL or AML protocol is generally made based on whether the lymphoid or myeloid  From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on November 21, 2018.

HSCT in Infant Leukemia  The use of HSCT in infant leukemia is variable, reflecting uncertainty regarding  the risk/benefit ratio of HSCT in this population. The published data (concisely reviewed  by Sison33) are not conclusive. There does appear to be a small minority of KMT2A-r  patients at high risk of relapse (very young age, very high WBC, and persistence of  MRD) that may benefit from HSCT in first remission.34, 35    Chemotherapy resistance and relapse in infant leukemia    Poor initial response to prednisone is significantly more common in infants than  in older children with ALL, and infant KMT2A-r ALL cells demonstrate enhanced in vitro  resistance to corticosteroids and asparaginase in assays using short term exposure of  bulk leukemia populations. Conversely, these cells appear to be particularly sensitive to  nucleoside analogues like cytarabine, perhaps related to high expression levels of the  membrane-bound nucleoside transporter ENT1.36, 37 Infant KMT2A-r AML cells do not  demonstrate enhanced resistance or sensitivity.38-40   Clinical data do not support the hypothesis that bulk leukemia chemoresistance  is responsible for poor outcomes. The typical pattern of failure for infant KMT2A-r ALL is  to achieve rapid complete remission with induction chemotherapy, but then relapse  several months later during active therapy. This suggests that the poor outcomes are  due primarily to the emergence of a chemoresistant population over time. The low rates  of second remission (about 40%) and very poor survival after relapse (about 20%) are  consistent with this hypothesis.41, 42   From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on November 21, 2018. For personal use only. 16    Genomic studies of large cohorts of diagnostic KMT2A-r infant ALL specimens  have revealed a relatively small number of cooperating genomic variants.43-46 A smaller  number of paired diagnostic/relapse pairs have been studied, but there appears to be  no significant increase or selection of mutations at relapse.44 Thus, it does not appear  that relapse in KMT2A-r infant ALL can be explained by the appearance of, or selection  for, subclones with resistance-inducing genomic mutations. As discussed in more detail  below, KMT2A-r infant ALL is associated with aberrant epigenetic programs. Emerging  data suggests that subclonal epigenetic changes may be responsible for  chemoresistance and relapse in KMT2A-r infant ALL,47 raising the possibility that  incorporating epigenetically-targeted therapies may be able to prevent relapse.  Novel Therapies   It is clear that our standard approaches to infant leukemia leave ample room for  improvement. The unique molecular biology of KMT2A-r leukemia has suggested novel  treatment approaches, several of which are in various stages of clinical investigation.  The importance of collaborative and innovative clinical trials for this disease cannot be  overemphasized. To that end, the 3 major cooperative groups in Tables 3 and 4 are  developing a joint protocol to enhance the ability to test novel treatment approaches and  improve the standard of care.  FLT3 inhibitors   KMT2A-r infant ALL is characterized by a distinct global gene expression  profile.48, 49 A notable component of this profile is striking overexpression of FLT3.50  FLT3 signaling is constitutively activated in these cases, either by activating mutations51,  52 or, more commonly, by autocrine activation via co-expressed FLT3 ligand.53  From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on November 21, 2018. For personal use only. 17    Moreover, FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibition (TKI) results in selective killing of these  samples and synergizes with chemotherapy in a sequence-dependent manner.51, 53-55  FLT3 overexpression has been shown to confer especially poor prognosis in KMT2A-r  infant ALL.56, 57 As shown in Table 4, COG trial AALL0631 was the first to incorporate a  novel, molecularly targeted agent into frontline treatment of KMT2A-r infant ALL.  Unfortunately, the trial failed to demonstrate a benefit for the addition of lestaurtinib,  perhaps due in part to pharmacologic limitations.58 Nevertheless, this trial serves as  proof-of-principle that novel targeted therapeutics can feasibly be tested in this high risk  group and has laid the groundwork for the international collaborative trial in  development.  Epigenetic agents   Genomic studies have revealed a striking paucity of cooperating genetic  alterations in infant KMT2A-r ALL compared to all other subsets of childhood ALL.43-46, 59  Accordingly, KMT2A-r infant leukemia is increasingly recognized to be driven by  aberrant epigenetic programs. As this complex network of interdependent epigenetic  processes is elucidated, novel therapeutic strategies are emerging.    KMT2A translocations include partner genes that recruit multiprotein complexes  with chromatin modifying activity to KMT2A target genes, inducing dysregulated  transcription of multiple genes. A required component of this aberrant epigenetic state  and KMT2A-r leukemogenesis is the H3K79 methyltransferase DOT1L.60-63 Potent and  highly selective small molecule inhibitors of DOT1L showed promising activity in  preclinical models of KMT2A-r leukemia.64, 65 Unfortunately, the clinical activity of  From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on November 21, 2018. For personal use only. 18    pinometostat, the first DOT1L inhibitor studied, was limited when used as monotherapy  in relapsed adults and children with KMT2A-r leukemia.66, 67   BRD4 is one of a number of epigenetic “reader” proteins that binds acetylated  histones and facilitates transcription downstream of MYC and other validated  oncogenes. A non-biased RNA interference screen of 243 chromatin modifying genes  identified BRD4 to be required for the maintenance of leukemia in an MLL-AF9 murine  model.68 Potent and selective small molecule inhibitors of BRD4 binding downregulated  characteristic KMT2A-r and MYC target genes and demonstrated in vitro and in vivo  antileukemic activity by inducing apoptosis and differentiation in murine models,  leukemia cell lines, and, most importantly, in a cohort of primary KMT2A-r infant ALL  cells.68, 69 Early phase clinical trials in adults with hematologic malignancies have been  or are being conducted with bromodomain inhibitors such as OTX015 and CPI-0610. A  phase 1 trial of OTX015 in adults with acute leukemia, including 2 with KMT2A-r,  demonstrated modest activity as a single agent.70  Also characteristic of KMT2A-r ALL is the epigenetic silencing of another set of  genes  with  tumor  suppressor  function  via  promoter  region  CpG  island  hypermethylation.71, 72 Increasing degrees of promoter hypermethylation correlated with  inferior survival in Interfant-99.72 Demethylating agents such as azacitidine, decitabine  and zebularine preferentially kill KMT2A-r ALL cells, and this correlates with the up- regulation of several of the identified silenced genes.71-73 Hypermethylation of certain  microRNAs (miRs), such as miR-152, also characterizes infant KMT2A-r ALL and has  been associated with inferior outcomes.74, 75 Based on these data, as well as the  aforementioned report of the critical role of subclonal methylation changes in  From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on November 21, 2018. For personal use only. 19    chemoresistance and relapse of infant KMT2A-r ALL,47 the COG (ClinicalTrials.gov  NCT02828358) and JPLSG (Umin.ac.jp UMIN29275) are each conducting pilot trials of  azacitidine in combination with the Interfant chemotherapy backbone.   Deacetylation of histone marks such as H3K9/14 is associated with gene  silencing and can be modulated with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors.  Connectivity maps have identified HDAC inhibitors as capable of reversing gene  expression profiles associated with chemotherapy resistance in relapsed childhood  ALL76 and in infant KMT2A-r ALL.77 A high throughput screen of a large panel of FDA- approved and investigational drugs in KMT2A-r infant ALL cell lines identified the HDAC  inhibitor romidepsin as efficacious and synergistic in vivo with cytarabine.78 Finally, the  HDAC inhibitor panobinostat was found to be effective in xenograft models of KMT2A-r  ALL.79 While demethylating agents and HDAC inhibitors are a promising strategy to  reverse the inherent chemoresistance of KMT2A-r infant ALL, a pilot study of decitabine  and vorinostat combined with reinduction chemotherapy in children with relapsed ALL  led to excessive infectious toxicity,80 so safety has yet to be demonstrated.  Targeting microenvironment interactions  The pattern of remission and early relapse suggests that chemotherapy-resistant  leukemia stem cells (LSCs) survive and can recapitulate the leukemia. Interactions  between infant KMT2A-r ALL LSCs and the bone marrow stromal microenvironment via  the CXCR4/SDF-1 axis have been shown to mediate survival and therapeutic  resistance in KMT2A-r ALL.81 In xenograft models of KMT2A-r infant ALL, CXCR4  inhibition with plerixafor led to markedly enhanced in vivo efficacy of FLT3 inhibitors,  suggesting that targeting leukemia-stroma interactions with CXCR4 inhibitors may  From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on November 21, 2018.

Dynamic upregulation of CXCR4 expression  on the surface of acute leukemias (including KMT2A-r cases) in response to cytotoxic  chemotherapy may enhance this stroma-mediated resistance and identify patients for  whom CXCR4 inhibition may be particularly effective.82 Subsequent preclinical studies  have demonstrated the efficacy of small molecule CXCR4 antagonism in reversing  chemoresistance, both in vitro and in vivo83, 84, and these findings led to a clinical trial of  plerixafor and chemotherapy in relapsed/refractory pediatric acute leukemia  (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01319864). The combination was safe but showed modest clinical  activity, although no KMT2A-r ALL patients were enrolled.85  Immunotherapy   The recent FDA approval of blinatumomab86 and tisagenlecleucel87 has  generated interest in immunotherapeutic approaches for high risk B-ALL subsets, to  include KMT2A-r infant ALL. A pilot trial of blinatumomab in combination with the  Interfant chemotherapy backbone has been initiated by the Interfant group  (Trialregister.nl NTR6359). One potential limitation, however, is that CD19 antigen is not  uniformly expressed in KMT2A-r leukemias. Case reports of immunologic “class  switching” from CD19+ lymphoid to CD19- myeloid phenotypes have been reported with  CD19-targeted immunotherapies88, 89, 90, and xenograft studies demonstrate leukemia  stem/initiating cell activity in CD19- subpopulations in KMT2A-r ALL cases.91-93 Low  levels of CD22 expression in KMT2A-r ALL may also limit the activity of inotuzumab.94  Another challenge to chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell technology in infants is  manufacturing product using autologous infant T-cells. Recently, a gene-editing  technique was used to simultaneously introduce the CD19 CAR construct and disrupt  mediators of allogeneic rejection (T-cell receptor alpha chain and CD52) into healthy  From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on November 21, 2018.

Remarkably, two  relapsed KMT2A-r ALL infants were treated and achieved molecular remission before  proceeding to HSCT.95 Ultimately, the success of immunotherapy for infant leukemia will  depend upon identifying the right antigen (or group of antigens) to target, since as  discussed, CD19 and CD22 may not be optimal.  Targeting RAS Pathway  Mutations in NRAS and KRAS have been found in 14% of KMT2A-r infant ALL.96  As has been found in other acute leukemias, RAS mutations tend to be subclonal and  not stable between diagnosis and relapse, raising the question of whether they  represent leukemia drivers.97, 98 However, a cohort in which 70 patients were negative  for RAS mutations and 9 were positive demonstrated a worse outcome among the RAS- mutant group,96 and preclinical studies suggest a potential role for MEK inhibition as a  targeted therapeutic strategy.99, 100  Conclusions and Future Directions  Infant leukemia is one of most difficult clinical situations encountered in pediatric  hematology/oncology. Standard approaches (consensus recommendations summarized  in Table 5) are curative in a minority of patients, and participation in clinical trials of  novel treatment approaches is strongly encouraged. While most treatment failures are  due to relapse, treatment related mortality and life limiting late effects in survivors are  also problematic. Recent discoveries regarding the unique biology of these leukemias  are fueling the development of a pipeline of exciting novel treatment strategies that are  increasingly being incorporated into clinical trials and have the potential to reduce both  relapse rates and treatment-related toxicities.

Wall, PhD; Tse-Hwei Choo, PhD; Jack Grinband, PhD; Jeffrey A. Lieberman, MD IMPORTANCE Despite strong theoretical rationale and preclinical evidence, several glutamate-targeted treatments for schizophrenia have failed in recent pivotal trials, prompting questions as to target validity, compound inadequacy, or lack of target engagement. A key limitation for glutamate-based treatment development is the lack of functional target-engagement biomarkers for translation between preclinical and early-stage clinical studies. We evaluated the utility of 3 potential biomarkers—ketamine-evoked changes in the functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) blood oxygen level–dependent response (pharmacoBOLD), glutamate proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS), and task-based fMRI—for detecting ketamine-related alterations in brain glutamate. OBJECTIVE To identify measures with sufficient effect size and cross-site reliability to serve as glutamatergic target engagement biomarkers within early-phase clinical studies. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This randomized clinical trial was conducted at an academic research institution between May 2014 and October 2015 as part of the National Institute of Mental Health–funded Fast-Fail Trial for Psychotic Spectrum Disorders project. All raters were blinded to study group. Healthy volunteers aged 18 to 55 years of either sex and free of significant medical or psychiatric history were recruited from 3 sites. Data were analyzed between November 2015 and December 2016. INTERVENTIONS Volunteers received either sequential ketamine (0.23 mg/kg infusion over 1 minute followed by 0.58 mg/kg/h infusion over 30 minutes and then 0.29 mg/kg/h infusion over 29 minutes) or placebo infusions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Ketamine-induced changes in pharmacoBOLD, 1H MRS, and task-based fMRI measures, along with symptom ratings. Measures were prespecified prior to data collection. RESULTS Of the 65 volunteers, 41 (63%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 31.1 (9.6) years; 59 (91%) had at least 1 valid scan. A total of 53 volunteers (82%) completed both ketamine infusions. In pharmacoBOLD, a highly robust increase (Cohen d = 5.4; P < .001) in fMRI response was observed, with a consistent response across sites. A smaller but significant signal (Cohen d = 0.64; P = .04) was also observed in 1H MRS–determined levels of glutamate+glutamine immediately following ketamine infusion. By contrast, no significant differences in task-activated fMRI responses were found between groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings demonstrate robust effects of ketamine on pharmacoBOLD across sites, supporting its utility for definitive assessment of functional target engagement. Other measures, while sensitive to ketamine effects, were not sufficiently robust for use as cross-site target engagement measures.

Downloaded From:  on 11/22/2017 A ll currently approved treatments for schizophrenia, in- cluding both typical and atypical antipsychotics, func- tion primarily by blocking dopamine D2 receptors.1,2 Nevertheless, these compounds are fully effective for only a minorityofindividualswithschizophrenia,indicatingtheneed for alternative treatment approaches.3,4 Recent theories im- plicate dysfunction of brain glutamatergic systems in general and of neurotransmission mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate- type glutamate receptors (NMDAR) in particular. This latter theory is based on the ability of phencyclidine, ketamine, MK- 801 (dizocilpine), or other NMDAR antagonists to induce clini- cal symptoms and neurocognitive dysfunction closely resem- bling those of schizophrenia.5-7 In rodent studies, effects of NMDAR antagonists such as ketamine8,9 are mediated, at least inpart,bystimulationofpresynapticglutamatereleaseinfron- tal brain regions and are reversed by compounds acting either to enhance postsynaptic NMDAR function or to diminish pre- synaptic glutamate release, which either reverse the primary deficitinNMDARdysfunctionorblocktheNMDARantagonist– induced increase in presynaptic glutamate release.9-11 Nevertheless,amajorlimitationtoglutamate-targetedtreat- mentdevelopmentisthelackofappropriatebiomarkerstoevalu- ate this effect in early-stage clinical trials to confirm target engagement.12,13Thepresentstudyevaluates3potentialbiomark- ers of functional target engagement by ketamine, reversal or blockadeofwhichwouldserveasfunctionalevidenceofabrain effect of novel glutamatergic agents in schizophrenia. The bio- markersincludeketamine-evokedchangesin(1)thefunctional magneticimaging(fMRI)bloodoxygenlevel–dependent(BOLD) response(pharmacoBOLD),(2)glutamateprotonmagneticreso- nance (1H MRS) spectroscopy, and (3) task-based fMRI.

Thefirstapproach,pharmacoBOLD,leverageseffectsofglu- tamateonbrainenergymetabolism.Duringnormalbrainhomeo- stasis, recycling of glutamate released from presynaptic gluta- matergic terminals accounts for approximately 50% of energy expenditure.14Inanimals,NMDARantagonist–inducedincreases inglutamatereleaseareaccompaniedbyincreasedlocalmetabo- lism and cerebral blood volume that reflect increased energy expenditure.11,15TheseeffectsarepreventedalongwithNMDAR antagonist–inducedbehaviorsbycompoundsthatblockpresyn- aptic glutamate release, such as lamotrigine or mGluR2/3 agonists.15,16 Compared with ketamine, dopaminergic agents, such as methylphenidate, have limited effect on cerebral blood volumeinadults.17InfMRI,increasesinregionalmetabolismare associated with increased local blood flow and BOLD signal.18 Here,weevaluatedtheseeffectscomparedwithplaceboinamul- ticenter trial setting. Second, we evaluated effects of ketamine on the local con- centration of glutamate and metabolites determined using 1H MRS. In 1H MRS, the concentration of glutamate, glutamine, or glutamate+glutamine (Glx) can be measured directly.19-21 Prior studies have shown dysregulated glutamate release in the me- dial prefrontal or anterior cingulate cortex in patients diag- nosed as having acutely psychotic, unmedicated schizophrenia,22-26 as well as those at high clinical risk.27 El- evated cingulate glutamate levels may also persist throughout later stages of illness in individuals who are antipsychotic re- sistant but not in those who are antipsychotic responsive28,29 and correlate with common allelic variants in glutamate- related risk genes.30 Several small studies have also shown ket- amine-inducedalterationsinbrainglutamatemetabolisminthe medial prefrontal or anterior cingulate cortex in healthy volunteers,31-33 but to our knowledge, the consistency of these findings in cross-site studies has not been evaluated. Finally, we examined the effect of ketamine on functional activationsobservedduringtheRelationalandItem-SpecificEn- coding (RISE) task,34,35 which is known to the engage dorsolat- eralprefrontalcortex(DLPFC)andhippocampalregionsinvolved inlong-termmemory.Patientsdiagnosedashavingschizophre- niashowreducedDLPFCBOLDandhippocampusactivationdur- ing relational encoding,36 suggesting task-based fMRI readouts involvingDLPFCorhippocampusinvolvementduringtheRISE task might serve as biomarkers as well. The primary goal of the study was to compare both the magnitude of response and feasibility of implementation of imaging-based biomarkers for glutamate-targeted drug devel- opmentinpsychoticdisordersacrossmeasureswithinthecon- text of a multicenter clinical trial as a method for validating a biomarker for future early-stage glutamatergic drug develop- ment in schizophrenia. In general, we hypothesized that ket- amine effects would be in the direction observed in both ani- mal studies with NMDAR antagonists and in schizophrenia— ie, toward increased BOLD response, increased 1H-MRS Glx levels, and reduced activation during the RISE task. Methods Participants The study was approved by the Yale University Institutional Review Board, the University of California, Davis Institu- tional Review Board, and the New York State Psychiatric In- stitute Institutional Review Board. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to participation. The Key Points Question Can imaging-based biomarkers be used for glutamatergic drug development in psychiatry? Findings In this randomized clinical trial including 53 volunteers, a direct comparison of 3 proposed neuroimaging-based target engagement biomarkers for glutamatergic treatment development in the context of a multicenter ketamine challenge study was performed. Significant ketamine effects were observed for the ketamine-evoked changes in the functional magnetic imaging blood oxygen level–dependent (BOLD) response, with lesser degrees of change for magnetic resonance spectroscopy and task-based BOLD responses. Meaning This trial validates the ketamine-evoked increases in functional magnetic imaging BOLD response as a cross-site biomarker for glutamatergic drug development in schizophrenia.

Design Participantswererandomizedtoketamineorplaceboina2:1ra- tio.Volunteersparticipatedin2magneticresonanceimagingses- sions at least 2 weeks apart, with the first magnetic resonance imaging session always being 1H MRS only and the second ses- sion incorporating both pharmacoBOLD and task-based fMRI. In the 1H MRS session, an initial structural scan was conducted for voxel placement. Anterior cingulate cortex Glx levels were then obtained in 15-minute blocks starting 30 minutes prior to infusion(2blocks)andcontinuinguntiltheendofthe1-hourin- fusion (4 blocks). Participants maintained their blinded group assignment across scanning sessions. Ketamine/Placebo Infusion Racemic ketamine hydrochloride (0.23 mg/kg infusion over 1 minutefollowedby0.58mg/kg/hinfusionover30minutesand then 0.29 mg/kg/h infusion over 29 minutes38,39) or placebo (normal saline) was administered. Clinical and Safety Measures Participants were rated with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Profile of Mood States (POMS), and Clinician Admin- istered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS)6 tests as well as the Psychotomimetic States Inventory40 after the scanning pe- riod ended. Imaging Methods Detailed imaging methods are provided in the eMethods in Supplement 2. Briefly, for pharmacoBOLD, T2-weighted echo- planar imaging scans were collected for 10 minutes prior to and during each ketamine infusion, with a repetition time of 2 sec- onds and with 32 slices at a resolution of 3.4 × 3.4 × 4.0 mm. A prespecifiedregionofinterestanalysiswasperformedusingthe midcingulate cortex.18 In addition, an exploratory whole-brain analysiswasperformedusingmultiplelinearregression.Voxel- wise thresholds were set at P < .05 and were corrected for mul- tiplecomparisonsusinggaussianrandomfieldtheory(P < .05). For 1H MRS, the region of interest was placed in the me- dial prefrontal cortex anterior to the genu of the corpus callo- sum, oriented along the anterior commissure–posterior com- missure line, and centered on the interhemispheric fissure, with dimensions 2.5 × 3.0 × 2.5 cm (volume, 18.8 cm3). The MRS acquisition used a standard point-resolved spectros- copypulsesequence(repetitiontime/echotime = 2000/80mil- liseconds) with 336 excitations. Four acquisitions (15 min- utes each) were conducted over the 1-hour infusion period and compared with the preinfusion baseline. For data analysis, 8-channel phased-array coil data were combined into a single regulartime-domainfree-inductiondecaysignal,usingtheun- suppressed voxel tissue water signal to derive the relative phased-array coil sensitivities. The primary outcome mea- sure consisted of the pre/post ketamine change score for the Glx to creatinine ratio. The RISE task was implemented in accordance with Rag- land et al.36 Briefly, participants viewed a series of visual de- pictions of objects during either an item-specific or relational encoding phase (eMethods in Supplement 2). The predesig- nated primary outcome measure was DLPFC BOLD activa- tion during the task. Group-level contrasts were made for encoding (relational minus item-specific), item recognition (hits minus misses for item-specific and hits minus misses for relational encoding), and associative recognition (hits minus misses). Structural masks from the WFU_PickAtlas41 were used to restrict analy- sestosubgroupsofactivatedvoxelswithinleftandrightDLPFC (Brodmann areas 9, 46, and 9/46). Secondary analysis as- sessed hippocampal effects.36 Statistical Analysis The ketamine effect on pharmacoBOLD and the RISE task were tested using a 2-sample t test (ketamine vs placebo). Ket- amine effects on the 1H MRS response measures were tested with repeated-measures analysis of variance of the Glx re- sponses across time during the infusion with 4 time intervals (0-15, 15-30, 30-45, and 45-60 minutes), treatment group, and time × treatmentgroupwithposthoccontrasts.Across-sitedif- ferences in each biomarker outcome were tested using an analysis of variance, with treatment, site, and treat- ment × site as fixed effects. Ketamine effects on clinical measurements (ie, BPRS, POMS,andCADSSmeasures)wereassessedusingchangescore measures (postinfusion minus preinfusion scores), except for the Psychotomimetic States Inventory measure, which was onlycollectedafterketamineinfusion.Associationsamongbio- marker responses, clinical measures, and blood levels of ket- amine and metabolites were assessed using Spearman corre- lations. Ratings on clinical measures were averaged across the 2 days for associations with biomarkers, and blood levels were takenfromthespecificday.Finally,logisticregressionwasused to model the odds of assignment to the ketamine group on the main response measures. The optimal cut points for sensitiv- ity and specificity were selected using Youden J statistic (sen- sitivity + specificity − 1). Between-group analyses were conducted using t tests. Ef- fect sizes were assessed using the Cohen d statistic.

However, no significant between-group differences were seen after the first acquisi- tion,leadingtostatisticallysimilarincreasesinGlxlevelsacross the remaining 45 minutes of the infusion period and a non- significant group difference across the entire infusion period (F3,126 = 1.54; P = .21).

Similarly, there was no significant activation effect in the hippocampus (t35 = 0.16; Cohen d = 0.08; P = .87). Clinical Ratings As expected, large effect size and between-group differences were seen for all behavioral scales (Table 2). On BPRS, only the positive subscale showed significant changes. Similar changes in clinical ratings were seen in the ketamine group on days 1 and 14 for all clinical measures except the CADSS, which was significantly higher on day 1. Ketamine Level Levels of ketamine, norketamine, and dehydronorketamine were obtained after the volunteers were removed from the scanner. Similar changes were seen on days 1 and 14 for ket- amine (mean [SD] ng/mL, 108.5 [33.0] vs 111.9 [31.0]; t30 = 1.59; P = .12)anddehydronorketamine(mean[SD]ng/mL,53.7[16.2] vs 67.0 [19.1]; t30 = 1.57; P = .13). For norketamine, signifi- cantlylowerlevelswereobservedonday1vsday14(mean[SD] ng/mL, 28.2 [15.8] vs 33.4 [22.5]; t30 = 3.35; P = .002). There were no significant associations with same-day ket- amine levels for any of the primary outcome variables. There were also no significant associations between any of the pri- mary outcome variables and levels of either norketamine or dehydronorketamine. Relationship With Symptom Measures Correlational analyses were conducted both across groups and within the ketamine group individually. Across groups, sig- nificant associations were seen between pharmacoBOLD in- creases and changes in the Psychotomimetic States Inven- toryscore(rs= 0.37;P = .007),BPRS(rs= 0.43;P = .001),CADSS (rs = 0.56; P < .001), and POMS (rs = 0.30; P = .03) (eTable in Supplement 2). However, associations were not significant within the ketamine treatment group. If across-group corre- lations were corrected for multiple comparisons, the associa- tion with POMS would no longer be significant. In contrast to pharmacoBOLD, no significant changes were observed for 1H MRS Glx levels relative to symptoms. By con- trast, left DLPFC activation to relational encoding items was significantly associated with both BPRS negative symptoms (rs = 0.43; P = .03) and in ketamine-treated individuals alone (rs = 0.46; P = .02). No significant changes were observed for hippocampal activation relative to symptoms. Group Assignment A final analysis evaluated the degree to which the proposed biomarkers could be used to predict group membership (ket- amine vs placebo group). As expected, pharmacoBOLD re- sponse (χ2 = 12.9; P < .001) significantly differentiated the groups, with sensitivity of 85.3% and specificity of 89.5%. Left DLPFC activation on the RISE task, despite absence of signifi- cant between-group difference, significantly predicted group membership (χ2 = 6.18; P = .01), with relatively high specific- ity (83.3%) relative to sensitivity (48.1%). Despite the signifi- cant between-group differences, Glx levels did not signifi- cantly predict group membership. A combined measure of pharmacoBOLD+RISE activation was highly predictive, with 90% sensitivity and 88.9% specificity, leading to correct clas- sification of 90% of participants. For pharmacoBOLD, a cut- off value of 0.5% increase in BOLD signal eliminated all pla- cebo responders while retaining 80% of ketamine responders.

One of the major obstacles to developing novelneurotherapeuticagentsatpresentisthelimitedavailabil- ity of validated biomarkers to establish a dose that reaches the desired target in the brain and produces some functional effect thatmayleadtoatherapeuticresponse.12,42Thereisacriticalab- senceofvalidatedbiomarkersinthecaseofglutamate-targeted treatments,whicharepresumedtoworkatleastinpartbymodu- lationofpresynapticglutamaterelease.Idealbiomarkersnotonly have large associated magnitudes of effect but also have high translatability across sites, permitting use in multicenter clini- cal trials.13 The present study evaluated 3 potential biomarkers of glu- tamate-based functional target engagement—pharmaco- BOLD, 1H MRS Glx, and task-based fMRI (RISE task)—based on their sensitivity to ketamine administration in healthy volun- teers. Critical issues include magnitude of effect and feasibil- ity for cross-site implementation. Although each measure has been studied in isolation, to our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate them in parallel in the same sample in a rigorouslydesigned,randomized,placebo-controlled,blinded, multisite investigation. TheprimaryfindingisthatthepharmacoBOLDresultswere veryrobust,withbothalargemagnitudeofeffect(Cohend = 5.4) andstrongcross-siteconsistency,suggestingitspotentialasabio- marker durable enough to be applied in multicenter studies, provided that adequate quality control, methodology, and minimum-capability 3-T magnetic resonance imaging systems from one of the major vendors (ie, Siemens, GE, or Philips) are used.Othermeasuresprovidedcomplementaryfindingsandmay possessadditionalbiomarkerutility,dependingonthetherapeu- tic target and experimental compound. AnimportantfeatureofthepharmacoBOLDmeasureisthat it recapitulates the effects of NMDAR antagonists in rodents, where acute administration of NMDAR antagonists increases blood flow, as measured by cerebral blood volume.11,15 Ef- fects are reversed by glutamatergic agents, such as mGluR2/3 receptor agonists,11,15 and NMDAR glycine-site modulators, such as D-serine or glycine transport inhibitors,43 as well as atypical antipsychotics, such as clozapine.11 Therefore, the pharmacoBOLD biomarker may be particularly relevant to de- veloping mGluR2/3 and NMDAR modulator–type com- pounds, establishing appropriate doses, and implementing ex- perimental medicine type drug development principles. In the present study, effect sizes for the pharmacoBOLD response were larger than those noted in prior studies using this approach, which have generally been in the range of 2.0 to 3.0 SD units.18,44 The larger effect size is likely because of the greater infusion of ketamine given (0.23 mg/kg) vs prior studies (0.1 mg/kg). As in prior studies, the BOLD response peaked within the first 5 minutes and was likely driven by the initial infusion, suggesting that sustained ketamine infusion is likely not required. In the present study, a cutoff value of 0.5% mean signal change fully separated individuals receiv- ing ketamine from placebo and could be used in target engage- Table 2.

ThepharmacoBOLDresponsewasalsosignificantlyassoci- ated with symptoms across but not within groups. This finding may reflect nonlinear relationships between pharmacoBOLD measuresandpsychosiswithintheketaminegroup,suchassatu- ration of the pharmacoBOLD response at high levels, as well as thresholdlevelsneededtoinducesymptoms.Additionally,symp- tom ratings were not obtained until the end of the scan session, potentiallyweakeningtheassociations.ThepharmacoBOLDre- sponsewashighlysignificantdespitebeingobtainedinthesec- ondscan,raisingthepossibilitythatevengreaterresultsandpo- tentially stronger correlations with behavior might have been obtained if no prior scan was performed. In prior studies, high test-retest reliability of the pharmacoBOLD response has been observed across administrations.18 IncontrasttothepharmacoBOLDresponse,Glxlevelsmea- sured by 1H MRS showed much smaller, albeit significant, ef- fect-size differences between treatments (Cohen d = 0.64; P = .04). The lower sensitivity of 1H MRS to ketamine effects may reflect difficulties in distinguishing synaptic from extra- synaptic glutamate. Finally, effects of task-based fMRI in this study were less robust than those of pharmacoBOLD. Nevertheless, a moder- ate to large effect size difference in left DLPFC activation in re- sponse to relational items was observed (Cohen d = −0.42; P = .06). These changes also correlated with severity of ket- amine-induced negative symptoms, both across treatment groups (r = 0.36; P = .03) and in the ketamine group itself (r = 0.43; P = .03). ChangesinleftDLPFCactivationalsocontributedtothedif- ferentiationofketamineandplacebotreatmentgroupsoverand above contributions of pharmacoBOLD. In particular, changes werehighlyspecifictotheketaminegroup,albeitwithrelatively lowsensitivity.KetamineisalsoknowntoaffectotherNMDAR- dependent functions, such as working memory,45 smooth pur- suit eye movement,46 and auditory information processing.47 Therefore, the combination of task-based measures with phar- macoBOLD may help refine the biomarker algorithm. Limitations Our study has limitations. We selected a single sequence— point-resolved spectroscopy echo time 80 acquisition with lin- earcombinationmodeldifferencemethodanalysis—thatcould be reliably implemented at each of the sites. It is possible that alternative 1H MRS approaches might have yielded stronger re- sults. A nonsignificant (P = .06) site-to-site variability was ob- served even with the consensus sequence and might be exac- erbated by site-specific measurement protocols. Conclusions One of the major hurdles to neuroscience-based treatment de- velopment in psychiatry is the lack of appropriate functional target engagement measures. The present cross-site, random- izedtrialdemonstratesthatketamine-inducedpharmacoBOLD provides a robust and reliable measure of excess cortical glu- tamate release and may therefore serve as an informative mea- sureforthedevelopmentofnovelglutamate-targetedtherapeu- tic agents. The study also supports the potential utility of MRS andtask-basedfMRI,pendingappropriatemethodrefinements, and enables future target-engagement based research for de- velopment of glutamatergic medications in schizophrenia.

Ness, MS, BSN, RNa,*, Cheryl Royce, MS, RN, CRNPb INTRODUCTION Today’s standard of care was yesterday’s clinical trial. Oncology clinical trials have been and will continue to be the cornerstone for improving outcomes for individuals at risk for and living with cancer. A clinical trial is a type of patient-oriented clinical research study that prospectively assigns participants, also known as human subjects, to one or more biomedical or behavioral interventions to evaluate health- related outcomes.1 Discovering these new interventions and developing, implement- ing, and monitoring a clinical trial involves many groups and individuals (Box 1). Collectively their responsibility is to ensure that the rights and well-being of the research participants are protected and to advance scientific knowledge by ensuring Disclosures: None. a Office of Education and Compliance, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, 10 Center Drive, Room 3-2571, MSC 1206, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA; b Office of Research Nursing, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, 10 Center Drive, Room 3-2571, MSC 1206, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA * Corresponding author.

The clinical trials nurse (CTN) serves as a study coordinator but may have different job titles (eg, Research Nurse Coordinator, Clinical Research Nurse, Clinical Research Coordinator) and may be supervised by a physician, investigator, or a non-nurse research manager.5–9 This article provides an overview of clinical trials, highlights the role of the oncology CTN (ie, the nurse in the role of study coordinator), and shares one organization’s process to unite all CTNs under one nursing office. OVERVIEW OF CLINICAL TRIALS Good Clinical Practice (GCP) is an international ethical and scientific set of standards for the design and conduct of research involving humans, including protocol design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analyses, and reporting.10 It includes both regulations, which are binding, and guidelines or guidances, which are not binding but recommended to be followed. In response to historical events, reg- ulations and guidelines have been developed (Box 2).2,3 Several groups with regulatory authority are involved in the conduct of clinical trials in the United States. In the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), the 2 main titles related to clinical trials are Title 45 (Public Welfare) and Title 21 (Food and Drugs). Guidance documents describe an agency’s interpretation of or policy on a regulatory issue. Title 45 Part 46 is interpreted by the Office for Human Research Protections. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) interprets Title 21 and its subparts.11,12 There are 5 types of clinical trials (Table 1).13,14 Treatment clinical trials can further be characterized by phases (Table 2).14–16 Advancements in cancer biology, genomic Box 1 Key groups and individuals responsible for ensuring good clinical practice Clinical trial sponsors including: Pharmaceutical companies Government agencies (eg, National Cancer Institute) Research teams Principal investigator Subinvestigators Research participant Study coordinator (nurse or non-nurse) Clinical data manager Statistician Research site collaborators Staff/infusion nurses Basic science and clinical laboratory staff Radiology staff Pharmacists Contract and billing staff Federal agencies Office for Human Research Protections US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Ness & Royce 134 Box 2 United States regulations related to clinical trials Title 45 Part 46 Subpart A: Protection of Human Subjects (1974, revised in 1981, 1991, 2005); also referred to as the Common Rule (1991) Subpart B: Pregnant Women, Human Fetuses and Neonates in Research (1975, revised 2001) Subpart C: Biomedical and Behavioral Research Involving Prisoners as Subjects (1978) Subpart D: Children Involved as Subjects in Research (1983) Subpart E: Registration of IRBs (2009) Title 21 Part 11: Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures Part 50: Protection of Human Subjects Part 54: Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators Part 56: Institutional Review Boards Part 312: Investigational New Drug Application Part 600: Biologic Products Part 812: Investigational Drug Exemptions Table 1 Types of clinical trials Trial Type Purposes Examples Prevention Evaluate better ways to prevent a diseasea from developing or returning Vaccine (eg, HPV vaccine) Exercise Screening Discover the best ways to detect a diseasea in the general population, or, for individuals who have a higher than normal risk of developing a disease, before symptoms start Laboratory test (eg, BRCA1) Imaging (eg, mammogram) Health history (eg, pedigree) Diagnostic Evaluate better ways to identify a particular diseasea Genetic tests (eg, VHL syndrome) Imaging tests (eg, PET scan) Quality of life/supportive care Explore ways to improve the comfort and the quality of life for individuals with a chronic illness Antiemetic Support group Treatment Develop better interventions for diseasea Drug Vaccine Device Surgery Radiation Psychotherapy Combination modalities Abbreviations: BRCA1, breast cancer genes 1; HPV, human papillomavirus; VHL, von Hippel Lindau. a Disease includes a disorder or health condition. Clinical Trials and the Clinical Trials Nurse 135 profiling, and the development of molecularly targeted agents (MTAs) have led trialists to rethink traditional trial designs. Basket, umbrella, and adaptive trials are examples of novel designs now being used in oncology clinical trials (Table 3).17,18 PROTOCOL DEVELOPMENT AND REVIEW PROCESS A protocol is the written detailed action plan that provides background about the clin- ical trial, specifies trial objectives, describes the trial’s design and organization, and Table 2 Phases of clinical trials Phase Goals Traditional Design I Determine dosing in humans - known as the MTD; conducted in adults before children Assess safety Evaluate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics May also be used to evaluate new treatment schedule, new drug combination strategy, and new multimodality regimen Open label, nonrandomized, dose escalation with cohorts of 3–6 research participants; known as a 3 1 3 design Increase dose gradually, most commonly using a modified Fibonacci schema Low starting dose based on the animal models to avoid serious toxicity II Provide initial assessment of efficacy or clinical activity Further define safety and toxicity Open label, 1 dose level based on the MTD; also known as the recommended phase 2 dose Most commonly a 2-stage design with an early stopping rule Increasing use of randomized designs III Efficacy compared with standard therapy Further evaluation of safety Randomization with or without blinding May include stratification based on disease-specific prognostic factors (eg, hormone receptor status in breast cancer) or other factors (eg, age, gender) Abbreviation: MTD, maximum tolerated dose.

Ness & Royce 136 ensures that trial procedures are performed consistently, protecting the research par- ticipants and providing appropriate data to answer the trial objectives. Box 3 outlines the various sections of a protocol. Protocols undergo various reviews before partici- pant enrollment. Some protocols undergo a scientific review (eg, National Cancer Institute [NCI]–designated cancer centers) and some need to have additional safety reviews: � Radiation safety review if ionizing radiation is used at a frequency greater than standard of care � Institutional Biosafety Committee and Office of Biotechnology Activities if human gene transfer is a component of the trial � Sponsor review if the protocol was written by an investigator and not the sponsor (eg, NCI-sponsored trials)19 All clinical trial protocols including the informed consent (IC) document undergo an ethical review by an institutional review board (IRB) before their implementation. The IRB is a committee charged with the review of human subject research. Its primary mandate is to protect and safeguard the rights and welfare of human subjects. Inter- nationally, the IRB may be known by other names, such as ethical review board or research ethics committee.19,20 Note that a clinical trial cannot begin to enroll partic- ipants until it has been approved by the IRB.

IC involves subjects having the capacity to agree for themselves to participate in a given situation (eg, clinical research). Informed consent is an important process in the clinical research.21 The IC document is a written tool used by the inves- tigator and/or other research team members to guide and reinforce the discussion with each patient about a research study. The IC document includes 8 required and 6 additional elements depending on the type of study and IRB policy (Box 4).11,22 Each IRB has an IC document template that needs to be used. When working on industry-sponsored trials or trials that are conducted at multiple sites (ie, multisite Box 4 Elements of an informed consent document (21 Code of Federal Regulations Part 50 and 45 Code of Federal Regulations Part 46) Eight essential elements A statement disclosing that the study involves research, including Explanation of the purpose of the research Invitation to participate Expected duration of participation Description of procedures to be followed Identification of any procedures that are experimental (eg, MRI that would not be done as part of standard of care, but for research only) Description of any foreseeable risks/discomforts Description of any benefits to patient or others Disclosure of any appropriate alternatives to study participation (eg, standard comfort measures) How patient’s confidentiality will be maintained For research that involves more than minimal risk, an explanation regarding compensation if injury occurs, what that compensation is, and how to obtain further information Contact persons for questions related to research and research subjects’ rights A statement regarding the voluntary nature of participation, including that refusal to participate does not involve any penalty or loss of benefit to the patient For applicable clinical trials under the FDA Amendment Act (sections 505 or 351), the statement, “A description of this clinical trial will be available on (www.clinicaltrials.gov). This Web site will not include information that can identify you. At most, the Web site will include a summary of results. You can search this Web site at any time.” Six additional elements The intervention or procedure may cause unforeseeable risks (eg, risk to fetus if patient should become pregnant) Circumstance for termination of participation by the investigator (eg, noncompliance with protocol’s safety assessments, sponsor terminates an Investigational New Drug application) Additional costs to the patient from participation Consequences of the patient’s decision to discontinue research participation Statement that the patient will be notified of significant new findings that may affect their decision to continue participation Approximate number of subjects Ness & Royce 138 trials), a sample IC document is provided to each investigator for reformatting per the reviewing IRB’s template. Individuals’ voluntary agreement to participate in a clinical trial is shown by their sig- natures on the IC document; this is referred to as obtaining consent. However, IC is an ongoing process of communication and mutual understanding between individuals and investigators. The research participants need to be provided with additional perti- nent new information (eg, new risks, new procedures) throughout their participation on a clinical trial in order to make a decision to remain on the clinical trial. The advancements in genomic profiling affect not only trial design but the IC docu- ment and process as well. The National Human Genome Research Institute recom- mends that the following be considered when addressing IC: � Broad versus specific consent � Considerations for families � Considerations for identifiable populations � Studies involving children � Studies involving participants who cannot give consent � Data and sample sharing through data repositories and biobanks � Return of results to participants23 THE RESEARCH TEAM Once the IC document is signed, protocol-specific procedures for eligibility screening begin. If eligible, the intervention begins, data are collected, monitoring and quality control activities occur, participants are removed from the protocol based on prespe- cified criteria, and data are analyzed. The results may be published and, if applicable, the results are reported in ClinicalTrials.gov, a registry for publicly and privately sup- ported clinical studies. It is the research team that orchestrates these activities. It is essential for all individuals involved in clinical research to have knowledge and under- standing of research-related laws and regulations to ensure GCP.24–26 Every clinical trial has a principal investigator (PI) who is accountable for the overall conduct of the trial and enrolls research participants. Other team members may include subinvestigators, study coordinator (nurse or non-nurse), clinical data man- ager, and statistician. The types of individuals and responsibilities vary based on the clinical setting. Table 4 outlines the general responsibilities of the PI, study coor- dinator, and research participant.24–29 Note that US regulations only outline the role of the investigator, not other research team members. ONCOLOGY CLINICAL TRIALS NURSE In the 1960s, early chemotherapy clinical trials provided new roles for nurses. Oncology nurses needed to develop new skills and new partnerships with physician investigators while caring for patients on clinical trials. This requirement not only included administering investigational agents but also coordinating the clinical trial.30 As nurses, oncology CTNs must adhere to the American Nursing Association Scope and Standards of Practice and Code of Ethics along with their state’s Practice Act. In addition to the responsibilities of the study coordinator listed in Table 4, oncology CTNs: � Provide and coordinate the care of the research participant � Know the diseases being studied � Understand the basics of genomics and molecularly targeted therapies, including implications for participant education and IC Clinical Trials and the Clinical Trials Nurse 139 � Assess adverse events using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events � Manage toxicities within the scope of license and protocol � Educate research staff and collaborators on an ongoing basis � Educate research participants and their significant others about: � Underlying disease processes � The clinical trial (eg, objectives, schema, adverse events) and their roles � Expectations for cure, control, palliation, or no benefit � Facilitate the ongoing IC process � Advocate for the patients (ie, research participants) and protocol26 Based on the wide variation of how the oncology CTN role was implemented across various practice settings and with feedback from the Oncology Nursing Society (ONS) CTN Special Interest Group, the ONS developed competencies for oncology CTNs. A complete set of the competencies can be found at https://www.ons.org/sites/default/ files/ctncompetencies.pdf.31 Initially published in January 2010, the ONS CTN compe- tencies are undergoing a revision that will: � Include new functional areas (eg, data management) incorporating some previ- ous categorizations � Separate required knowledge from skills and behaviors Table 4 Responsibilities of the principal investigator, study coordinator, and research participant Role General Responsibilities PI Comply with all applicable federal regulations and state laws affecting the protection of human subjects Comply with all applicable IRB policies, procedures, decisions, conditions, and requirements Conduct study in accordance with the current IRB-approved protocol Design the clinical trial and/or provide study oversight Personally conduct and supervise the clinical trial Study coordinator Recruit and retain research participant Schedule protocol-specific procedures Secure and reinforce IC Prepare for and participate in monitoring visits and audits Ensure integrity of protocol is maintained by enforcing timelines for study visits and other procedures Maintain regulatory files Assist PI in submitting protocol and consent for initial review, continuing review and amendments Report serious adverse events and unanticipated problems Participate in data management and data quality assurance Research participants Respect research staff and other participants Read the consent form and other documents Ask questions if they do not understand something about the study, their rights and responsibilities Know when the study begins and ends Follow directions for all protocol-related procedures Show up at scheduled appointments on time or inform research staff within a reasonable time if they need to reschedule Report symptoms and other problems they experience during the study Provide truthful answers to questions asked throughout the study Inform staff if they decide to withdraw from the study Ness & Royce 140 � Add recommended resources to aid in knowledge and competency achievement � Add a more advanced level of competencies for those with more experience or who are functioning at a higher level than novice CTNs THE REORGANIZATION OF CLINICAL TRIALS NURSES: ONE INSTITUTION’S EXPERIENCE Necessity is the mother of taking chances. —From Roughing It by Mark Twain, American author and humorist The Center for Cancer Research (CCR) is the basic and clinical intramural research program of the NCI. Within the CCR is the Office of the Clinical Director, which sup- ports CCR’s clinical research program by providing biostatistical expertise, education and training, data management, auditing and monitoring activities, regulatory support and expertise, and informatics for data collection and storage. The growth of CCR clinical research programs requiring support of the CTN has increased over the years. Historically the management of CTNs was within the spe- cific programs including CTN recruitment, supervision, training, personnel actions, and performance evaluations. The programs were silos in which the team func- tioned. By 2011, there were 74 CTNs across 13 programs, supporting 68 PIs. As the workload of one program grew there was little to no flexibility to have CTNs cross-cover from another program. The scope and volume of work were discrepant across programs. When programs expanded their research portfolios, necessitating more CTN staff, the request was forwarded to the Office of the Clinical Director for evaluation and approval. There were no standard performance evaluation metrics. Work practices for leave and attendance and telecommuting were different across programs. Communication practices were not efficient or timely. There were a multi- tude of reasons that supported the CCR leadership to consider centralizing the CTNs. In 2011 the CCR leadership recognized that the organization would benefit from an integrated infrastructure for CTNs. The primary purpose was to allow nurses to report to nurses in the hopes of: � Establishing a career path for CTNs � Establishing core CTN competencies � Increasing training � Developing standard policies for time and attendance � Allowing for the cross-training required to respond to variances in workload � Establishing an esprit de corps � Efficiently recruiting and hiring CTNs � Implementing human resource actions consistently � Establishing efficient mechanisms for communication � Ensuring collaboration with the PIs OFFICE OF RESEARCH NURSING The new office would be called the Office of Research Nursing (ORN) and would become part of the Office of the Clinical Director. The Deputy Director for the CCR was aware that this was a major cultural shift for CTNs and the PIs. Several town hall meetings for CTNs and PIs were held in the fall of 2012 to present the idea for a new model and to elicit feedback from these stakeholders. Building the infrastructure for this office took place between September 2012 and March 2013. The ORN was given a budget to include salaries, travel, training, and sup- plies. A director needed to be recruited for the office and 3 team leaders needed to be Clinical Trials and the Clinical Trials Nurse 141 hired into the ORN. The director was an experienced leader in nursing within the CCR with background as a CTN and nurse practitioner. The team leaders selected had strong backgrounds in research nursing and leadership, and strong institutional knowledge. A leadership team was formed and an administrative assistant hired with responsibilities for travel, supplies, management of timecards, and facilitation of the recruitment and hiring processes. Performance evaluations were created using the ONS competencies. The ORN director thought that the consolidation of nursing under nursing leadership had the potential to develop quality CTNs to support clinical research within the organization. LEADING CHANGE THROUGH ENGAGEMENT In order for the new model to be successful, the chief needed to lead change by engaging clinical research staff in a mutually supported vision of the future while being sensitive to the cultural change experienced by the CTNs and the PIs. In Getting Change Right, Seth Kahan32 shares tips for successful change: So what’s a change leader to do? Create ways for people to get together and converse. Get them participating, engaged, and involved. This is the road to per- sonal investment, enthusiastic support, and genuine buy-in. This is how you move people across the line from “I have to do this” to “I want to do this.” And that makes all the difference in the world.32 The challenge with the reorganization was getting engagement across the research team. On the first day in office, the director made appointments with each of the 74 CTNs and interviewed them to understand their background (Box 5), motivations, and career aspirations. CTNs were asked: � How long they had been in their jobs � What kept them in their jobs � What obstacles they faced that prevented them from getting their jobs done � What was on their wish list Overwhelmingly, the CTNs said that what kept them in their jobs were the rela- tionships with their colleagues, including investigators and other physicians. They were intellectually challenged by the research protocols and science, autonomous in their positions, and driven to help patients. The overriding impediment related to performing their jobs better was a lack of communication about policies and procedures. They wanted to know best practices and what other nurses were doing that improved their efficiency. Much of the information gained from these interviews was congruent with the reasons for the reorganization of the CTNs. The director was comfortable knowing that the needs of the CCR and the CTNs were in alignment. Establishing Structure The ORN leadership team met and developed the ORN draft mission and vision state- ment, which was presented to the CTNs for their input and feedback. This draft was a key first step to engaging staff in decision making for what was to be a long-term meaningful partnership between leadership and staff. To provide a unique, cohesive team of superior research nurse specialists to carry out the mission of the CCR through a culture that supports continuing education, mentorship, professional development, and collaboration while balancing Ness & Royce 142 comprehensive patient coordination and quality clinical and translational research. —Vision statement for the ORN, 2013 The leadership team participated in a 12-week supervisory course on self- development, program development, and leading though change. Training included the legalities of supervision, conflict resolution, leadership development, forming and leading teams, and handling human resource issues. In addition, the director and team leads were afforded the opportunity to have 3 months of individual executive coaching, which has proved to be invaluable for the development of the ORN. The ORN established 4 teams, each with a team lead (Fig. 1). The ORN leadership took the following into account while creating teams: � CTN experience � Existing research team dynamics � Research team workload (eg, types of protocols, phases of clinical trials, number of protocols) � Support staff (eg, data manager, scheduling support staff, midlevel providers) The aim was to provide manageable teams for each team leader to supervise while supporting the vision statement of the ORN. Communication and Transparency An immediate response to the needs of both the CCR and the CTN was to initiate a communication plan. The ORN developed a monthly newsletter that includes staff recognition, educational opportunities, new policies/procedures, staff departures, Box 5 Research nurses demographics Educational background Master’s degree in nursing: 14 Master’s degree in other (in addition to the nursing degree): 7 Bachelor of Science in nursing: 52 Associate degree: 8 Years in nursing Less than 5: 3 From 5 to 10: 12 From 11 to 15: 8 Greater than 15: 51 Certification in nursing Oncology certified nurse: 20 Bone marrow transplant certified nurse: 2 Advanced practice nurse in genetics: 2 Certification in clinical research Certified clinical research coordinator: 1 Certified clinical research professional: 2 Clinical Trials and the Clinical Trials Nurse 143 staff hires, and regulatory updates. The newsletter is distributed via e-mail and posted on a dedicated Web site. Informal staff meetings called Coffee and Chats began and are held monthly on 3 different days of the week so that all staff have an opportunity to attend. The purpose of these meetings is for staff to network, share best practices, and receive up-to-date information from the leadership team. The CTNs are invited to join the meetings but not required to attend the meetings. Part of the communica- tion plan includes the development of the ORN Wiki page. The site is maintained by the ORN chief and contains newsletters, listing of the nurses, their contact information, and procedures for promotion. An e-mail distribution list with all research nurses, ORN leadership, and additional staff from the Office of the Clinical Director (eg, deputy clinical director, nurse educator, protocol support office director, and quality manage- ment coordinator) allows rapid, thorough communication to all CTNs. All team leaders developed relationships with their CTNs, the teams in which the team leaders worked, and the respective PIs. It was imperative to know what each in- dividual on the research team valued and find ways to help them achieve that as quickly as possible. The team leaders attended research team and data management meetings as well as clinic when needed. The team leaders continue to meet regularly with PIs. Quickly work groups began to emerge composed of staff who identified a need or a problem and developed a team to address solutions. One work group emerged to address documentation needs in the electronic medical record. Other work groups developed, including: � Wellness Committee with a goal of helping CTNs strike work-life balance � Journal Club to provide CTNs with a forum to discuss peer-reviewed literature related to oncology, nursing, or clinical trials � Model for cross-coverage and what it meant to cover for a CTN who was out of the office Making Changes From its inception the ORN leadership made a strategic decision that changes in prac- tice would be small with a likelihood of being successful, and that we would build from there. It was about building trust and respecting staff input. A decision was made that all changes would be presented to the staff with rationale for the change, they would have input, and leadership would listen. The PIs and other stakeholders were included in the communications. We would use champions to advocate for new ideas and Fig. 1. Organizational chart for the ORN. Ness & Royce 144 change that needed to be addressed. We would communicate to the staff the final proposal and then roll out the changes and fully communicate to all involved. The first change that was presented was standard operating procedures for time, attendance, and telework. This process was successful, because the staff trusted the process, allowing for subsequent changes. We established ground rules for conducting busi- ness, including work schedule options, performance evaluations, and promotion pro- cedures. All changes were approached in the manner of our change management philosophy. NOW THAT THERE IS ENGAGEMENT, TIME TO GET DOWN TO BUSINESS A priority of the CCR was to improve cross-coverage and flexibility to cover workload. There were 4 programs that included only 1 CTN. We paired these single CTN teams with other CTNs to cover workload in times of absences. We also identified the need to have a senior resource CTN who could be deployed to teams for various reasons (eg, cover for CTNs out on extended leave, audit assistance, or coverage because of a temporary increase in workload). This resource CTN was available to precept new staff. In addition, all team leaders ensured that they had a working knowledge of their team’s protocols so that they could back up a CTN if necessary. There had been a promotion process in place at the CCR for CTNs who want to be considered for promotion. The process was evaluated by leadership and senior staff who had previously gone through the process. Feedback was elicited from staff and the process was finalized. Five nurses have been promoted using the new promotion process incorporating a leadership initiative as part of their senior CTN status. New CTN orientation has been redesigned. Each new CTN is assigned a preceptor. New CTN orientation procedures and standardized checklists have been developed to guide the new CTNs and their preceptors. An integral piece of the orientation is the formalized clinical trial training provided by the nurse educator. COMPETENCY ASSESSMENT AND VALIDATION Once the basic infrastructure of the ORN was created and engagement started, the next initiative was competency assessment and validation. Working with the CCR nurse educator, the ORN embarked on developing behavioral indicators for 2 of the 9 ONS competencies (ie, professional development and documentation) using working groups that included CTNs and leadership. A validation tool was created (Table 5) and the nurse educator developed a facilitator’s guide (Table 6) with input from ORN leadership. The nurse educator validated the competency for the ORN director and each of the team leaders using the facilitator’s guide. Time was spent discussing how the team leaders would use the guide to validate the research nurses’ competency. In January 2015 CTNs were notified that competency sign-off was to be performed in March. Be- tween January and March 2015 educational sessions were offered to staff and by the end of March all CTNs were signed off on their professional development competency by their team leader. Additional competency validation is ongoing. ASSESSMENT OF THE OFFICE OF RESEARCH NURSING AND FUTURE PLANS Three years following the inception of the ORN, consolidating the CTNs under 1 office has been viewed as success by the CTNs and the research teams. This new infrastruc- ture was supported by an organizational commitment to optimize this key resource for the clinical program. Future strategic direction includes completion of competency assessment and validation using the ONS competencies, development of a workload Clinical Trials and the Clinical Trials Nurse 145 Table 5 Professional development competency validation sign-off log Behavioral Indicators Assessment Method Rating Comments Self Validator 1.

SUMMARY Clinical research is the foundation for improving human health. Clinical trials, a type of clinical research, explore ways to prevent, screen, diagnose, treat, and improve qual- ity of life for individuals with a chronic illness. Protecting research participants and ensuring quality data are the responsibility of many individuals and groups. Participant protection includes the ethical review of protocols and the IC of the participants. The protocol serves as a written, detailed action plan that supports the scientific rationale for conducting the trial and outlines all trial procedures to be conducted all to ensure the participants’ safety and the quality of the data. A key member of the oncology research team is the oncology CTN, who may or may not be supervised by a nurse. Using the process of engagement, one organization has been able to restructure the CTNs into a nurse-supervisor model with direct benefits to the CTNs. REFERENCES 1. National Institutes of Health.

Decades of clinical research in acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute  respiratory failure, pneumonia, and sepsis have yielded improvements in supportive care, which  have translated into improved patient outcomes.  Novel therapeutics have largely failed to  translate from promising pre-clinical findings into improved patient outcomes in late-phase  clinical trials.  Recent advances in personalized medicine, “big data”, causal inference using  observational data, novel clinical trial designs, pre-clinical disease modeling, and understanding  recovery from acute illness promise to transform the methods of pulmonary and critical care  clinical research.  To assess the current state, research priorities, and future directions for adult  pulmonary and critical care research, the NHLBI assembled a multidisciplinary working group of  investigators.  This working group identified recommendations for future research, including: (1)  focusing on understanding the clinical, physiological, and biological underpinnings of  heterogeneity in syndromes, diseases, and treatment-response with the goal of developing  targeted, personalized interventions; (2) optimizing pre-clinical models by incorporating  comorbidities, co-interventions, and organ support; (3) developing and applying novel clinical  trial designs; and (4) advancing mechanistic understanding of injury and recovery in order to  develop and test interventions targeted at achieving long-term improvements in the lives of  patients and families.  Specific areas of research are highlighted as especially promising for  making advances in pneumonia, acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, and acute respiratory  distress syndrome.

Published March 09, 2020 as 10.1164/rccm.201908-1595WS   Copyright © 2020 by the American Thoracic Society  INTRODUCTION For fifty years, caring for patients with acute pulmonary disease has been a defining  element of critical care (1, 2).  Identifying interventions to prevent, treat, and facilitate recovery  from pneumonia, acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF), and acute respiratory distress  syndrome (ARDS) has been a priority for the critical care community and the National Heart,  Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) (3).  Pre-clinical research (4, 5) and clinical trials (6) have  yielded major improvements in supportive care, which have translated into improved patient  outcomes (7, 8).  However, novel therapeutics have largely failed to improve outcomes when  tested in late-phase clinical trials (9–13).   In order to assess the current state, research priorities, and future directions for adult  pulmonary and critical care research, in September 2018 the NHLBI assembled a Working  Group for Clinical Research in Adult Pulmonary and Critical Care.  This multidisciplinary group  included leaders in clinical, translational, and basic science research in pulmonary, critical care,  and emergency medicine.  Specific areas of content expertise (pneumonia, AHRF, ARDS, and  sepsis) and methodological expertise (molecular biology, pre-clinical disease models, early- phase clinical trials, late-phase clinical trials, long-term outcomes, health services research, and  biostatistics) were represented.  The meeting was divided into two types of sessions: sessions  addressing principles applicable to the design of clinical research in adult pulmonary and critical  care, and sessions addressing specific disease processes.  Each session was followed by  group discussion of the common themes and priorities. The first section of this report describes the predominant themes that emerged as having  the greatest potential for contributing to progress in clinical research in adult pulmonary and  critical care (Table 1).  The second section outlines research priorities for three specific  conditions highlighted for discussion by the working group: pneumonia, AHRF, and ARDS. Page 6 of 57  AJRCCM Articles in Press. Published March 09, 2020 as 10.1164/rccm.201908-1595WS   Copyright © 2020 by the American Thoracic Society  OVERARCHING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE CRITICAL CARE RESEARCH  Heterogeneity of Patients, Conditions, and Treatment Effect A fundamental challenge for critical care research today is to identify which critically ill  patients are likely to experience improved clinical outcomes with a given therapy.  Meeting this  challenge will require understanding three types of risk: (1) a patient’s overall risk of an  outcome, (2) the proportion of a patient’s overall risk of an outcome that is attributable to the  disease of interest, and (3) the proportion of the patient’s overall risk of an outcome that is  amenable to treatment with the therapy being evaluated (Figure 1, Figure S1). Overall Risk Within a population of critically ill patients, individual patients may differ greatly in their  risk of an outcome (14).  Patients at higher risk of a specific outcome have the potential to  experience larger absolute reductions in that outcome with treatment (when disease-attributable  and treatment-responsive risk are constant) (Figure 1) (14, 15).  Patients at low risk of a  specific outcome may have little potential to benefit from the treatment, but may still experience  its adverse effects (14).  Enrolling patients at high risk of an outcome (prognostic enrichment) in  critical care trials can ensure a high absolute event rate in the control group, potentially  decreasing sample size, increasing power, and improving benefit-risk balance.   Attributable Risk Critical illness is complex, and frequently only a portion of a patient’s overall risk of an  outcome is due to the disease of interest (attributable risk), while much of the patient’s risk of an  outcome is due to comorbidities or concurrent organ failures (16–19) (Figure 1).  For example,  Page 7 of 57  AJRCCM Articles in Press. Published March 09, 2020 as 10.1164/rccm.201908-1595WS   Copyright © 2020 by the American Thoracic Society  the overall in-hospital mortality among patients with ARDS is 30-40% (7).  As much as 80% of  the mortality risk among patients with ARDS, however, may be attributable to the underlying  disease or concurrent organ failures, rather than to ARDS itself (20).  Thus, preventing or  treating ARDS may produce only a small decrease in overall mortality.  Hence, moribund  patients, who have a high overall risk of death of which only a small portion is attributable to the  disease of interest, are frequently considered unlikely to benefit from study treatments and  excluded from clinical trials of ARDS therapies.  Historically, critical care trials have selected  sample sizes using overall rates of an outcome (21).  Using more conservative estimates  focused on the risk attributable to the disease, rather than the patient’s overall risk, may allow  more realistic sample size estimations (Figure 1A).   Treatment-responsive Risk The difference between an individual’s outcome with a treatment versus without the  treatment is the “treatment-responsive risk” (Figure 1C).  Patients more likely to respond to a  particular treatment may be identified using demographic characteristics (22), pathophysiology  (23), prior response to the treatment (24), or a disease characteristic related to the treatment’s  mechanism of action (e.g., genomic or proteomic factor) (25).  Selectively enrolling patients in  critical care trials who are more likely to respond to the treatment (predictive enrichment) can  produce larger absolute and relative risk reductions, decrease sample size, and improve the  benefit-risk balance for patients (23, 26–28). Critical Illness Syndromes, Phenotypes, and Endotypes Identifying patients likely to respond to a disease-specific treatment requires  understanding the biology of the disease, the likely mechanistic effect of the treatment, and the  interaction between the two. Historically, many critical illnesses (such as sepsis and ARDS)  have been considered syndromes, defined by observable signs and symptoms, but not  Page 8 of 57  AJRCCM Articles in Press. Published March 09, 2020 as 10.1164/rccm.201908-1595WS   Copyright © 2020 by the American Thoracic Society  necessarily specific to underlying biological processes. Ideally, such syndromic definitions would  be replaced with increasingly-precise disease phenotypes (29), sub-phenotypes, and endotypes  (Table 2).  Critical care may learn from the fields of oncology and asthma, which have used  biological pathways to define disease, identify therapeutic targets, and design efficient clinical  trials (25, 30–32).  This will require critical care research to develop valid proxy measures of  mechanism in the causal pathway between intervention and outcome.  Large observational and interventional datasets with standardized clinical phenotyping,  physiological measures, and biological samples from both acute illness and post-acute recovery  should be used to propel understanding of phenotypes, sub-phenotypes, and their mechanisms.   Partnerships between academia, industry, and the Food and Drug Administration will be  required to develop and validate approaches to rapid phenotyping and theragnostics (strategies  that combine a diagnostic test that identifies patients likely to respond and targeted therapy  based on that test’s results) for use in clinical trials. Markers of sub-phenotypes may be “static”,  such as baseline plasma cytokine concentration (33), or “dynamic”, such as a patient’s  physiological response to a change in positive end-expiratory pressure at the beginning of an  ARDS trial (34).  Ultimately, new interventions in critical care may be developed and tested  using biological criteria rather than clinical syndromes, including potentially testing treatments in  sub-phenotypes of patients that cut across historically separate clinical syndromes.   Pre-clinical Research  Major advances that have improved clinical outcomes for patients with ARDS began with  pre-clinical animal studies.  Research in small and large animal models established that higher  tidal volumes and high airway pressures were injurious to the normal and injured lung, paving  the way for clinical trials to identify a marked reduction in mortality with use of lower tidal  volumes (4–6).  Similarly, the potential benefit of a conservative approach to fluid management  Page 9 of 57  AJRCCM Articles in Press. Published March 09, 2020 as 10.1164/rccm.201908-1595WS   Copyright © 2020 by the American Thoracic Society  in ARDS was based on animal models of acute lung injury that demonstrated less pulmonary  edema with reduced pulmonary vascular hydrostatic pressure (35).  Studies involving pre-clinical models must be designed with a specific aim and must be  understood within that specific framework.  For some pre-clinical models, the aim will be purely  to advance mechanistic understanding (e.g., examining lung epithelial tissue factor knockout  mice to understand determinants of alveolar capillary barrier permeability).  For many pre- clinical models, the aim is to examine a new therapeutic and establish a mechanism of benefit  and a proof of principle that the new therapy might have potential value in the clinical setting.   To accomplish this objective, there is substantial need for pre-clinical models that have more  direct clinical relevance. For example, a recent international expert consensus provided  recommendations for more representative pre-clinical models of sepsis (many of which apply to  other critical illnesses) (36).  Overall, pre-clinical models need to: (1) examine model systems  beyond rodents (e.g., large animals (37), ex vivo human lungs (38), lipopolysaccharide  inhalation in human volunteers (39)); (2) include covariates and comorbidities in animal models  (e.g., age, diabetes, immunosuppression); (3) induce sepsis in a manner similar to onset of  sepsis in humans (e.g., microorganisms common in human sepsis (40), sites other than the  peritoneal cavity (41), prior microbial exposure to establish immunological memory and trained  immunity (42)); (4) include organ dysfunction and organ support in animal models (e.g.,  mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure); (5) administer cointerventions similarly to current  clinical care for human patients with sepsis (e.g., administration of antimicrobials and crystalloid  solutions after, rather than before, sepsis onset); and (6) use clinically-relevant outcomes over  an appropriate time-scale.  Ideally research using animal models should evaluate the full  spectrum of critical illness from prevention and early treatment through established disease and  the resolution and recovery phases.  In addition to more clinically-relevant pre-clinical models,  Page 10 of 57  AJRCCM Articles in Press. Published March 09, 2020 as 10.1164/rccm.201908-1595WS   Copyright © 2020 by the American Thoracic Society  pre-clinical research should leverage highly controlled and replicable circumstances to  understand not just whether a therapy works, but also the circumstances under which it does  not work, and the effects of specific aspects of the disease on the model and the therapy.  An  American Thoracic Society Consensus document provides detailed recommendations for how  animal studies of acute lung injury can be designed to encompass key elements of ARDS (43).   Another important issue with animal studies in sepsis and ARDS is the widespread lack  of transparent, quality reporting of study design and implementation; including reporting  randomization, blinding, and statistical power (44, 45).  Ideally pre-clinical research in  pulmonary and critical care should move to adopt The Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo  Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines (46). Optimizing pre-clinical models by incorporating  randomization and blinding may improve the eventual translation of promising novel  therapeutics from pre-clinical research to human clinical trials. Early-phase Clinical Trials and Surrogate Outcomes Early-phase clinical trials are highly controlled studies enrolling small numbers of  carefully selected patients that aim to advance understanding of pathophysiology (47, 48),  define the route, dose, and side effects of a novel therapy (49), or assess the effect of a novel  therapy on surrogate outcomes (50).  Identifying surrogate outcomes for use in early-phase  clinical trials is an urgent unmet need for critical care research (51).  A surrogate outcome is a  laboratory, survey, or performance-based measurement or a physical sign used as a substitute  for a clinical outcome.  For a surrogate outcome to be valid, the effect of the therapy on the  surrogate outcome must predict the effect of the therapy on the clinical outcome.  Development  of validated, short-term surrogate outcomes could smooth the transition from pre-clinical models  to early-phase clinical trials, increase the efficiency of adaptive trials, and facilitate the  incorporation of long-term patient-important outcomes into a broader range of trials.  For long- Page 11 of 57  AJRCCM Articles in Press. Published March 09, 2020 as 10.1164/rccm.201908-1595WS   Copyright © 2020 by the American Thoracic Society  term outcomes specifically, biological (e.g., S100B), structural (e.g., cortical thickness on  magnetic resonance imaging), or functional (e.g., neuronal activity on functional magnetic  resonance imaging) biomarkers would ideally eventually predict cognitive outcomes (52–54),  assess the short-term efficacy of interventions (55), and elucidate the mechanisms of injury and  recovery in critical illness (54, 56). Clinical Study Design In addition to the challenges summarized above regarding heterogeneity of patients,  conditions, and treatment effect, the therapeutic window for many critical care interventions is  narrow and early.  Patients are often vulnerable or cognitively impaired, which complicates  participation in research (57–59). To address these challenges, critical care research should: (1)  develop and apply novel trial designs (e.g., adaptive trials, platform trials); (2) leverage  electronic health records (EHR) to conduct pragmatic trials and observational research; (3)  advance the understanding of and approaches to informed consent in acute care research; and  (4) apply advanced observational research methods to inform both the design of trials and  clinical care.   Adaptive and Platform Trials Adaptive and platform trial designs hold the potential to minimize exposure of critically ill  adults to ineffective therapies, while shepherding effective therapies from development to  clinical practice quickly and cost-effectively. An adaptive trial is defined as a trial designed to  allow for prospectively planned modifications to trial features (e.g., number of study groups,  sample size per group, enrollment criteria, dose or frequency of the intervention) based on  accumulating data from subjects in the trial (Figure S2). Adaptive designs may gain efficiency  Page 12 of 57  AJRCCM Articles in Press. Published March 09, 2020 as 10.1164/rccm.201908-1595WS   Copyright © 2020 by the American Thoracic Society  from adaptive enrichment of the study population, early discontinuation of worse-performing  treatments, and seamless transition from early to late-phase trials.  A platform trial is defined as a trial using a single master protocol and research  infrastructure to simultaneously evaluate multiple interventions and/or disease subpopulations in  multiple substudies (Figure S2). Platform trials gain efficiencies from shared control groups,  adaptive borrowing of information from similar groups of patients, and shared infrastructure and  governance. However, there may be challenges including considerable pre-trial planning (e.g.,  statistical modeling, patient selection, organization of study arms, within-trial adaptations),  funding (e.g., traditional funding mechanisms may not easily handle a trial with no fixed sample  size; a trial that tests multiple experimental agents owned by multiple companies cannot easily  be sponsored by a single company), study monitoring, and consent (e.g., communicating risks  and benefits to patients for each separate agent being tested).  Trials that combine features of adaptive and platform designs (adaptive platform trials)  are currently addressing choice of antibiotic, use of steroids, and optimal ventilator strategy in  community acquired pneumonia (NCT02735707) and evaluating interventions to improve  outcomes of elective surgery (NCT03861767).  Additional efficiency may be gained by  integrating adaptive platform trials with the EHR in the form of randomized, embedded,  multifactorial, adaptive, platform (REMAP) trials (60). Adaptive and platform trials in critical care face specific design challenges and potential  limitations.  Methods developed for oncology trials with long enrollment windows, interventions  implemented and monitored over long durations, and biologically established short-term  surrogate outcomes may not extrapolate straightforwardly to critical care trials.  The complexity  of critical illness and the significant potential for interactions between multiple interventions and  Page 13 of 57  AJRCCM Articles in Press. Published March 09, 2020 as 10.1164/rccm.201908-1595WS   Copyright © 2020 by the American Thoracic Society  co-interventions requires careful consideration during the design and sample size estimation of  adaptive and platform trials. Pragmatic Trials Pragmatic trials aim to evaluate the effectiveness of a treatment under “real world”  conditions by incorporating broad eligibility criteria, administration of the intervention by treating  clinicians, and simplified data collection for patient-important outcomes (61).  Pragmatic trial  designs are well-suited to critical care comparative effectiveness questions for which the  required sample size is large, generalizability is a primary focus, or the intervention is more  reliably delivered by clinical personnel than by study personnel (e.g., a trial of tracheal intubation  vs laryngeal mask airway during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest where research personnel are not  present and the intervention is urgent).  In the unpredictable environments of the pre-hospital  setting, emergency department, and intensive care unit, executing traditional study procedures  (e.g., screening, consenting, enrolling, randomizing, and delivering the intervention) during a  narrow therapeutic window may be challenging, disruptive to clinical care, or impossible.  For  questions where early intervention is paramount, specific pragmatic designs may improve  representative patient enrollment and reliable delivery of interventions.  For example, cluster- randomized, cluster-crossover, or stepped-wedge trials, in which providers or units are  randomized, may facilitate examination of urgent or emergent critical care interventions that  would be challenging to rigorously evaluate using patient-level randomization (62, 63).   Pragmatic trials may provide the sample size and breadth of patients necessary to  examine not only the average effect of an intervention among all patients to whom the  intervention might be applied in clinical practice, but also the estimated effects of the  intervention for individual patients (64). Page 14 of 57  AJRCCM Articles in Press. Published March 09, 2020 as 10.1164/rccm.201908-1595WS   Copyright © 2020 by the American Thoracic Society  Leveraging Electronic Health Records Trials with traditional, adaptive, platform, or pragmatic designs (and observational  research) may all potentially gain efficiency by leveraging the EHR.  Applications that interface  directly or indirectly with the EHR may facilitate multiple steps of a traditional randomized trial,  including: (1) screening for eligible patients (e.g., an ARDS “sniffer” (65)); (2) prompting and  documenting informed consent (e.g., point-of-care consent for patients and clinicians (66)); (3)  generating study group assignment (e.g., EHR-embedded randomization (67)); (4) delivering  the intervention (e.g., via order-sets or an advisor (68)); (5) monitoring treatment compliance  and adverse events (69); and (6) providing data on co-interventions and short- and long-term  outcomes (70).   Challenges to be addressed include: improving quality and standardization of data entry  in the EHR; developing registries and reproducible approaches for automatically extracting  validated EHR data; building systems for real-time monitoring of adverse events; embedding  machine learning models for phenotyping patients using EHR data; addressing data security  and data sharing concerns in multi-center trials; and collaborating with third-party and EHR  vendors for support of clinical research.  A potential benefit of integrating clinical research into  the delivery of critical care through the EHR is to facilitate implementation of new evidence into  practice as a part of a learning healthcare system (71). Informed Consent Critical care research faces unique challenges regarding informed consent.  Critical care  research occurs in complex environments with patients who frequently lack decision-making  capacity and need interventions on a timescale of minutes or hours, rather than days.  Current  federal regulations specify two approaches to informed consent applicable to critical care  Page 15 of 57  AJRCCM Articles in Press. Published March 09, 2020 as 10.1164/rccm.201908-1595WS   Copyright © 2020 by the American Thoracic Society  research: (1) enrollment with prospective informed consent from patients who have full decision- making capacity or from an available legally authorized representative, or (2) enrollment with  waiver of or exception from informed consent (EFIC) when obtaining informed consent is  impracticable (e.g., because of patients’ illness), and obtaining informed consent from a legally  authorized representatives is impracticable (e.g., due to the urgency of the intervention).   Alternative approaches to prospective informed consent could be optimized for patients who are  acutely ill but awake (e.g., abbreviated consent with informed refusal), sedated or in severe pain  (e.g., abbreviated consent, assent, or dissent), or clinically unstable but possibly aware (e.g.,  simple disclosure) (72).  Federal regulators and stakeholders in critical care research should  evaluate alternative approaches to informed consent in the specific context of pre-hospital,  emergency medicine, and critical care research.  Simply denying current and future critically ill  patients the opportunity to benefit from new research because traditional models of informed  consent do not work well is unacceptable.  Instead, models of informed participation in research  are needed that reflect the realities of the context in which critical care is practiced and  recognize the obligation of healthcare professionals and institutions to continuously improve the  quality of clinical care through research (73).  Achieving these aims will be facilitated by  involving patients, families, and community members in each stage of critical care research from  design to dissemination (74). Advanced Methods for Observational Research For clinically important questions in critical care that cannot be readily answered in a  clinical trial, analyses of observational data provide an important source of causal inference.   Observational data can quantify the incidence of the disease (75), estimate the frequency of  outcomes (76), identify subphenotypes (77), provide risk-adjusted associations between  interventions and outcomes (78), and provide a sustainable context into which interventional  Page 16 of 57  AJRCCM Articles in Press. Published March 09, 2020 as 10.1164/rccm.201908-1595WS   Copyright © 2020 by the American Thoracic Society  studies are integrated (79).  Increasingly, modern analytic techniques (80) applied to well- curated datasets may address many sources of confounding and either mirror the results of  randomized trials (81) or provide generalizable information about patients under-represented in  traditional explanatory trials.  The advent of “big data”, from “-omics” to million-patient EHR  registries, provides the opportunity for complex, dynamic, multi-level datasets to be gathered,  curated, and integrated across ICUs, hospitals, and regions.  Priorities for future critical care  research using “Big Data” are summarized in Table 3. Long-term Patient-Important Outcomes Core Outcomes and Measures Over the past decade, substantial progress has been made in understanding which  outcomes after critical illness are important to patients and how these outcomes should be  measured (82).  A program of research (www.improveLTO.com), including systematic reviews  (83), international surveys of patients, caregivers, clinicians, and researchers (84), and an  international modified Delphi consensus process (85, 86) produced a recommended Core  Outcome Set and Core Outcome Measurement Set for all studies evaluating outcomes after  hospital discharge for survivors of acute respiratory failure.  Statistical methods have been  developed for analyzing such functional outcomes while addressing truncation due to mortality  (87).  To facilitate interpretation of results across trials, future research evaluating patient- important outcomes after hospital discharge should include the established Core Outcome Set,  in addition to study-specific outcomes.  The Core Outcome Set consists of: survival, health- related quality of life, mental health, pain, cognition, physical function, muscle and/or nerve  function, and pulmonary function (85).  The established Core Outcome Measurement Set (86)  Page 17 of 57  AJRCCM Articles in Press. Published March 09, 2020 as 10.1164/rccm.201908-1595WS   Copyright © 2020 by the American Thoracic Society  should be used, and measurement instruments for core outcomes currently lacking consensus  should be evaluated (88).  Long-term Outcomes in Randomized Trials Long-term patient-important outcomes within a randomized trial may serve as the  primary outcome (capturing a causal process affected by the intervention with a measurable  effect size) (89, 90), secondary outcomes (important explanatory variables for which the study  may have insufficient power) (91), safety outcomes (measures of harm through the primary  causal mechanism or other pathways), or descriptive outcomes (characterizing the trajectory of  the cohort over time regardless of differences between groups).  Specific long-term patient- important outcomes should be considered as the primary outcome for future critical care trials in  which the mechanistic effect of the intervention is anticipated to affect such outcomes, and as  safety outcomes in many critical care trials in which the effect of the intervention on such  outcomes is uncertain.   Knowledge Gaps about Long-term Outcomes Several knowledge gaps currently limit the broader use of long-term patient-important  outcomes in critical care research.  First, limited progress has been made in understanding and  measuring patients’ pre-illness baseline function and trajectory (which is a prerequisite to  understanding how much disability is induced by critical illness and might be preventable with  intervention) (92).  A standardized approach to retrospectively ascertaining pre-illness  conditions and trajectories could be developed, validated, and applied to observational and  interventional critical care research. Second, understanding the mechanism and timing of injury and recovery is a  prerequisite to designing trials with the right intervention, dose, timing, frequency, intensity, and  Page 18 of 57  AJRCCM Articles in Press. Published March 09, 2020 as 10.1164/rccm.201908-1595WS   Copyright © 2020 by the American Thoracic Society  duration to improve long-term, patient-important outcomes.  Large cohort studies should  advance mechanistic understanding of injury and recovery for patients and families by collecting  clinical and biological samples before, during, and after acute illness.  Contemporaneously, we  should endeavor to understand adaptation to injuries that cannot be prevented or healed, but  whose impact on health and function can be mitigated. Third, future research should evaluate the effects of critical illness not only on patients  but on families, caregivers, and healthcare professionals.  Interventions should be evaluated  that target a family-centered model of care, including enhanced social and community support,  mental health interventions, or respite care.  Engaging patients and families in critical care  research may provide new insights into questions, methods, and outcomes and ensure  accountability and a patient- and family-centered research focus (74).  Improving long-term  outcomes for critically ill patients may also require evaluating interventions to prevent and treat  “burn out” among health care professionals, either organizationally (e.g., shift scheduling) or  personally (e.g., mindfulness training) (93). RESEARCH IN SPECIFIC DISEASES Pneumonia Pneumonia is the most common cause of both sepsis and ARDS, and is a leading cause  of death in the United States (6, 94, 95).  Decreasing the incidence, severity, and sequelae of  pneumonia is a priority for research in adult pulmonary and critical care.  Improving  understanding of, and treatment for, pneumonia faces several challenges.  First, pneumonia is  falsely considered to be merely an acute illness.  Patients with pneumonia experience residual  effects on cytokine levels past hospital discharge (96, 97) and clinical symptoms for months  (98).  Research should delineate host factors that determine susceptibility to pneumonia and  Page 19 of 57  AJRCCM Articles in Press. Published March 09, 2020 as 10.1164/rccm.201908-1595WS   Copyright © 2020 by the American Thoracic Society  factors that influence resolution of lung injury and long-term sequelae (42, 99–101).  Second,  pneumonia is incorrectly perceived to be merely a localized illness.  Research should examine  factors that influence the transition from local infection in the lung (pneumonia) to inflammatory  responses elsewhere in the lung (ARDS) or systemically (sepsis).  Research should also  examine the mechanisms linking pneumonia to cardiac, cerebrovascular, renal, and other non- pulmonary sequelae, independent of sepsis, hypotension, or metastatic infection (102).  Third,  pneumonia is frequently treated as a syndrome.  Cohort studies collecting clinical and biological  samples before, during, and after severe pneumonia (99) should identify biological pathways  (endotypes) underlying clinical presentations of pneumonia and mediators of injury resolution  (103, 104) to target interventions at mechanisms rather than clinical syndromes (105).  Specific  research priorities for community acquired pneumonia are presented in Table 4. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure AHRF, characterized by tachypnea and diminished arterial partial pressure of oxygen,  occurs in 25-50% of ICU patients (106).  A fundamental challenge to AHRF research is that  numerous distinct diseases (e.g., cardiogenic pulmonary edema, community acquired  pneumonia, acute eosinophilic pneumonia) or syndromes (e.g., sepsis, ARDS) may present as  AHRF. Research in AHRF should balance the imperative to identify effective, common therapies  for AHRF across a broad range of patients with the reality that identifying targeted, mechanistic  therapies may require dividing patients with AHRF by the underlying biological processes,  trajectories, and phases of illness.  The degree to which the underlying biology and response to  therapy is shared between the syndromes of AHRF and ARDS remains unclear, including  whether the recently proposed sub-phenotypes of ARDS (33) have AHRF counterparts.  Large  observational cohort studies with detailed phenotyping, endotyping, and genotyping are needed  to understand the relationships between pneumonia, AHRF, and ARDS.  Examples of important  Page 20 of 57  AJRCCM Articles in Press. Published March 09, 2020 as 10.1164/rccm.201908-1595WS   Copyright © 2020 by the American Thoracic Society  unanswered questions in the clinical care of mechanically ventilated patients with AHRF are  provided in Table 5.  ARDS ARDS has been an archetypal illness for adult critical care (6, 107, 108).  Decades of  basic, translational, and clinical research have improved scientific understanding of ARDS  (109).  Clinical trials have identified strategies for supportive care (many related to minimizing  the harms of mechanical ventilation) that reduce systemic inflammation (110) and improve  patient outcomes (6, 111).  No pharmacological therapy for ARDS has been shown to reduce  short-term or long-term mortality.  In this way, ARDS exemplifies the challenges and  opportunities facing adult pulmonary and critical care research outlined in this summary.   Improving outcomes for patients at risk for ARDS, with established ARDS, and  recovering from ARDS remains a priority for adult pulmonary and critical care research.  Each of  the overarching recommendations for future critical care research described above applies to  future clinical research in ARDS (112), as summarized in Table 6. Meeting these challenges in  ARDS research may help clear the path for clinical research in adult pulmonary and critical care  more broadly and advance the shared goal of enhancing health, lengthening life, and reducing  illness and disability for critically ill adults and their families. SUMMARY This NHLBI working group made several recommendations for future clinical research in  adult pulmonary and critical care.  Increased focus on understanding the clinical, physiological,  and biological underpinnings of heterogeneity in syndromes, diseases, and treatment-response  will improve the development of targeted interventions to be tested with novel and efficient  Page 21 of 57  AJRCCM Articles in Press. Published March 09, 2020 as 10.1164/rccm.201908-1595WS   Copyright © 2020 by the American Thoracic Society  clinical trials.  Optimizing pre-clinical research by using designs with randomization and blinding  and incorporating comorbidities, co-interventions, and organ support into animal models may  improve the translation of promising novel therapeutics from pre-clinical research to late-phase  clinical trials.  Developing novel biomarkers associated with patient prognosis and treatment- response may help ensure that clinical trials evaluate novel therapeutics for the right patients at  the right time.  Adaptive, platform, and pragmatic trial designs may efficiently identify efficacious  new therapies and compare the effectiveness of existing ones.  Incorporating long-term patient- important outcomes into large-scale observational studies and clinical trials will improve  understanding of patient trajectories and mechanisms of injury and recovery and allow  evaluation of targeted interventions to improve the lives of patients, caregivers, and healthcare  professionals.  Pneumonia, AHRF, and ARDS offer specific promising research opportunities to  improve mechanistic understanding of disease and test available therapies with the potential to  improve patient outcomes.

Relationships between overall risk, disease-attributable risk, and treatment- responsive risk.  The x-axis displays, for a theoretical population of critically ill patients with a  disease of interest, each patient’s predicted risk of death, ranging from 0% (will almost certainly  survive) to 100% (will almost certainly die).  The y-axis displays the observed percentage of  patients who die, ranging from 0% (no patients died) to 100% (all patients died).  The light gray  shading denotes the deaths that were caused by the disease of interest (disease-attributable  risk).  The dark gray shading denotes deaths that were caused by comorbidities or concurrent  organ failures, rather than the disease of interest.  The gray stripes denote deaths prevented by  treatment.  A disease-specific treatment will generally be able to prevent more deaths among  patients who have a greater overall risk of death (prognostic enrichment) and whose risk of  death is primarily due to the disease being treated rather than comorbidities or concurrent organ  failures (Panel A).  A specific therapy may have a greater effect on outcomes in a highly  treatable disease compared with a poorly treatable disease (Panel B).  Which patients respond  to a specific treatment depends on the mechanism of action and the biology of the disease.  The  probability of responding to a specific treatment might be greatest among patients at high  overall risk or low overall risk (Panel C); or might be completely independent of overall risk.   Disease-specific treatments would generally be expected to prevent deaths from the disease of  interest (light gray), whereas some supportive therapies might be expected to prevent deaths  from the disease of interest (light gray) and deaths from comorbidities or concurrent organ  failures (dark gray).

Summary of Overarching Recommendations for Future Critical Care Research Heterogeneity of Patients, Conditions, and Treatment Effect For critical illness syndromes like sepsis or ARDS,  research should focus on understanding the clinical,  physiological, and biological underpinnings of  heterogeneity in syndromes, diseases, and treatment- response to improve the development of targeted  interventions and the design of clinical trials. Pre-clinical Research and Early-phase Clinical Trials Optimizing pre-clinical models by incorporating  comorbidities, co-interventions, and organ failure and  support and improving the use of biomarkers and  surrogate outcomes in early-phase clinical trials can  close the gap between mechanistic discovery and  successful late-phase clinical trials. Clinical Study Designs Adaptive and platform designs may increase the  efficiency of evaluating novel therapies for a disease or  subphenotypes of a disease.  Cluster-level trials and  trials leveraging electronic health records may increase  the efficiency of comparing the effectiveness of common  therapies for broad groups of patients. Long-term Patient-important Outcomes Future research should incorporate measurement of  long-term patient-important outcomes and potential  surrogate outcomes into observational and  interventional studies to advance mechanistic  understanding of injury, recovery, and adaptation.  Trials  should test interventions targeting these mechanisms to  improve the lives of patients and their caregivers. Page 45 of 57  AJRCCM Articles in Press.

Research Priorities for Community Acquired Pneumonia Summary of Research Priorities Illustrative Examples Prior to  pneumonia  (Prevention)  Evaluate systemic and pulmonary markers of host  susceptibility to pneumonia  Examine mechanisms that defend the lung against  pneumonia, including the ability to eliminate microbes  (immune resistance) and the ability to withstand injury  from infection and inflammation (tissue resilience)  Develop and test interventions that reverse or slow the  progression of increasing pneumonia susceptibility  Examine the effects of antecedent respiratory infections  on innate immunity in the lung (e.g., alveolar macrophage  phenotypes) and local immunological memory in the lung  (e.g., resident memory T cells) Use imaging and biospecimens to define and differentiate mechanistic  signals in “protected” individuals (e.g., young healthy humans; animal  models with relevant exposures establishing lung protection) vs. more  “susceptible” individuals (e.g., humans at high risk for pneumonia;  animal models with relevant risk factors).  Test if those signals calibrate  pneumonia risk when measured in human populations or shift  pneumonia risk when manipulated in animal models.   During  pneumonia (Treatment)  Advance cross-disciplinary evaluation of host-pathogen  interactions   Collect pulmonary and non-pulmonary biospecimens in  observational and interventional studies to identify  biological pathways (endotypes) underlying clinical  presentations of pneumonia to target interventions at  mechanisms rather than clinical syndromes  Examine factors that influence the transition from  localized infection (pneumonia) to inflammatory  responses elsewhere in the lung (ARDS) or systemically  (sepsis)  Develop and test interventions that (1) help the host to  more efficiently kill microbes, (2) diminish the anatomical  and physiological damage from infection and  inflammation, and (3) interrupt pneumonia’s non- pulmonary sequelae (e.g., muscle wasting)  Leverage new technology for rapid, comprehensive  pathogen identification to ensure that evaluation of  pneumonia treatments occurs in the context of early and  appropriate antibiotic therapy  Elucidate the transition from infection and inflammation  to resolution and repair (e.g., the role for specialized pro- resolving mediators), and the implications for  immunomodulatory therapy Identify candidate pharmacologic agents which phenocopy signaling  pathways tied to protection or reverse signaling pathways tied to injury,  and test lead candidates in experimental systems for abilities to bolster  immune killing of microbes or resilience of lung and extrapulmonary  tissues.   After  pneumonia (Facilitating  resolution  and recovery)  Examine the mechanisms linking pneumonia to long-term  pulmonary sequalae (e.g., accelerated chronic respiratory  disease) and non-pulmonary sequelae (e.g., cardiac and  cerebrovascular events, impaired cognition)  Incorporate non-infectious outcomes (e.g., cardiovascular  events) into long-term outcomes in pneumonia research  Define trajectories of recovery after pneumonia, and the  biological, clinical, and social factors that influence these  trajectories Identify discrete molecular, physiological, or clinical signals that  discriminate pneumonia patients who developed adverse long-term  outcomes from others that did not.  Test those signals for prognostic  value in human patients and causation in animal models.  Page 48 of 57  AJRCCM Articles in Press.

Research Questions in Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure with Invasive  Mechanical Ventilation Examples of Research Questions Extracorporeal Support  Does veno-venous (VV) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation improve outcomes  for patients with mild-to-moderate ARDS or for patients with AHRF without ARDS?   Should extra-corporeal carbon dioxide removal be used to facilitate ultra-low tidal  volume ventilation? Spontaneous Breathing  Can extra-corporeal carbon dioxide removal facilitate safe spontaneous breathing?   Should we encourage spontaneous breathing by early transition to pressure  support ventilation?  Should we encourage spontaneous breathing with airway pressure release  ventilation?  Among spontaneously breathing patients, should we actively limit tidal volume? Personalized ventilation  Should we measure patient effort and titrate ventilatory support to achieve  normal levels?  Does limiting driving pressure or mechanical power improve outcomes beyond  pressure- or volume-limited ventilation?  Does minimizing asynchrony improve patient outcomes? Comparative effectiveness  How do outcomes compare between higher positive end-expiratory pressure and  prone positioning overall and for specific subpopulations of patients?

Methods by which the workshop was designed, conducted, and reported The initial concept for the workshop was drafted by National Heart Lung and Blood  Institute (NHLBI) staff (L.A.R., N.R.A.) and approved by NHLBI leadership. NHLBI staff  generated a list of preliminary workshop session topics and possible speakers, and then selected  a workshop chair (G.R.B.). The workshop session topics were refined based on the workshop  chair's input. Session chairs (T.R.M., M.N.G., B.T.T., E.A.C., T.J.I., R.D.S.) and the lead author  for the workshop report (M.W.S.) were selected by NHLBI staff and the workshop chair.  Speakers (C.S.C., M.A.M., N.D.F., B.D.L., J.P.M., R.G.W., W.H.S., D.C.A., M.N.G., C.W.S.,  M.H.B., D.M.N., C.L.H., M.M., T.J.I., R.O.H.) and their assigned topics were selected by  NHLBI staff, the workshop chair, and the session chairs. Session chairs provided guidance to  speakers in advance of the workshop and asked each speaker to provide recommendations for  future critical care clinical research for discussion at the end of their talk. All speakers submitted  a 2-page summary with references on their specific topic before the workshop. Additional  workshop attendees (S.D.A., R.G.B.) were selected by NHLBI staff and the workshop chair to  enrich the workshop discussion.  During the workshop, two working group participants recorded content of the sessions  and discussions independently (M.W.S., D.M.N.).  At the end of each session, the session chairs  led discussion with the entire group to formulate recommendations. At the end of the workshop,  the workshop chair led discussion with the entire group to finalize and prioritize overall  recommendations. After the workshop, the workshop report was drafted by M.W.S. with input  by G.R.B. and L.A.R., and critically revised by all co-authors.      Page 54 of 57  AJRCCM Articles in Press.

Important topics beyond the scope of the current working group.   The following topics were identified as outside the scope of the current working group but  important for future consensus efforts and scientific prioritization. Topic Group Topic Item Patient, family,  and community  engagement  Advancing methods for involving patients, families, and communities in the design, conduct,  analysis, implementation, and dissemination of critical care research.  Conducting empirical studies of research recruitment, informed consent, surrogate informed  consent, return of research results to participants and families, and mobile health technologies in  critical care research  Collaborating with patients, families, communities, clinicians, researchers, sponsors, and federal  regulators to achieve the optimal application of exception from and waiver of informed consent to  critical care research Precision  Medicine  Advancing methods for phenotyping and understanding biological, genetic, and clinical  heterogeneity  Developing diagnostic (e.g., rapid assay) and theragnostic (e.g., biomarkers that identify  subphenotypes associated with pathways that produce differential treatment response) tools for  critical care research  Advancing understanding of the influence of pre-test probability in diagnostic testing in critical care  research  Advancing understanding of human physiology and pathophysiology through highly controlled  studies with detailed measurements of disease and intervention among a small number of carefully  selected patients.

0%%%%%%Original Investigation | Diabetes and Endocrinology Association of Second-line Antidiabetic Medications With Cardiovascular Events Among Insured Adults With Type 2 Diabetes Matthew J. O’Brien, MD, MSc; Susan L. Karam, MD; Amisha Wallia, MD, MS; Raymond H. Kang, MA; Andrew J. Cooper, MSc; Nicola Lancki, MPH; Margaret R. Moran, MPH; David T. Liss, PhD; Theodore A. Prospect, FSA, MAAA; Ronald T. Ackermann, MD, MPH Abstract IMPORTANCE Understanding cardiovascular outcomes of initiating second-line antidiabetic medications (ADMs) may help inform treatment decisions after metformin alone is not sufficient or not tolerated. To date, no studies have compared the cardiovascular effects of all major second-line ADMs during this early decision point in the pharmacologic management of type 2 diabetes. OBJECTIVE To examine the association of second-line ADM classes with major adverse cardiovascular events. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study among 132 737 insured adults with type 2 diabetes who started therapy with a second-line ADM after taking either metformin alone or no prior ADM. This study used 2011-2015 US nationwide administrative claims data. Data analysis was performed from January 2017 to October 2018. EXPOSURES Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), basal insulin, and sulfonylureas or meglitinides (both referred to as sulfonylureas hereafter). The DPP-4 inhibitors served as the comparison group in all analyses. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was time to first cardiovascular event after starting the second-line ADM. This composite outcome was based on hospitalization for the following cardiovascular conditions: congestive heart failure, stroke, ischemic heart disease, or peripheral artery disease. RESULTS Among 132 737 insured adult patients with type 2 diabetes (men, 55%; aged 45-64 years, 58%; white, 63%), there were 3480 incident cardiovascular events during 169 384 person-years of follow-up. Patients were censored after the first cardiovascular event, discontinuation of insurance coverage, transition from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) to end of ICD-9 coding, or 2 years of follow-up. After adjusting for patient, prescriber, and health plan characteristics, the risk of composite cardiovascular events after starting GLP-1 receptor agonists was lower than DPP-4 inhibitors (hazard ratio [HR], 0.78; 95% CI, 0.63-0.96), but this finding was not significant in all sensitivity analyses. Cardiovascular event rates after starting treatment with SGLT-2 inhibitors (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.57-1.53) and TZDs (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.76-1.11) were not statistically different from DPP-4 inhibitors. The comparative risk of cardiovascular events was higher after starting treatment with sulfonylureas (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.23-1.49) or basal insulin (HR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.81-2.27) than DPP-4 inhibitors. (continued) Key Points Question Are second-line antidiabetic medications (ADMs) associated with cardiovascular events among insured adult patients with type 2 diabetes who are initiating second-line therapy? Findings This cohort study of 132 737 adults with type 2 diabetes found that glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors were associated with similar cardiovascular outcomes. Sulfonylureas and basal insulin were associated with comparatively higher cardiovascular risk. Meaning Clinicians may consider prescribing newer ADM classes more routinely after metformin rather than sulfonylureas or basal insulin. + Invited Commentary + Supplemental content Author affiliations and article information are listed at the end of this article.

Higher cardiovascular risk was associated with use of sulfonylureas or basal insulin compared with newer ADM classes. Clinicians may consider prescribing GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLT-2 inhibitors, or DPP-4 inhibitors more routinely after metformin rather than sulfonylureas or basal insulin. JAMA Network Open. 2018;1(8):e186125. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2018.6125 Introduction Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in type 2 diabetes, and reducing its burden is an important goal of antidiabetic medications (ADMs).1,2 Metformin, which may have cardiovascular benefits, is widely recommended as first-line therapy.2,3 However, there is a lack of consensus about choosing subsequent ADMs among patients who do not achieve adequate glycemic control with metformin or do not tolerate it.2,4 Comparing cardiovascular outcomes of second-line ADMs during this early transition in diabetes pharmacotherapy may help improve treatment decisions after metformin or in place of it. Use of ADMs has increased owing to the rising prevalence of diabetes and a proliferation of novel therapeutic classes. Recent placebo-controlled trials of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors generally found no cardiovascular benefits or harms.5-7 However, some trials of glucagon- like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors reported reductions in composite cardiovascular outcomes and some individual cardiovascular events.8-14 These trials specifically recruited participants with a high burden of cardiovascular disease who were taking multiple ADMs. Therefore, it is not known whether their findings apply to the broader population with diabetes. Older research on second-line ADMs suggested cardiovascular harms associated with sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), and insulin.15 To date, no studies have directly compared the cardiovascular effects of all contemporary ADM options among patients starting second-line therapy. Our study investigated the comparative effectiveness of all major second-line ADM classes on major adverse cardiovascular events among insured adult patients with type 2 diabetes. By examining cardiovascular outcomes among patients initiating second-line ADMs in the real world, this study aimed to complement findings from individual drug trials and further inform ADM choices for the broad population of patients currently receiving these medications.16,17 Methods Study Design We conducted a retrospective, cohort study using national administrative claims data collected from April 2011 to September 2015.18 To minimize the potential for differences in diabetes duration and severity that may be related to ADM selection, we focused comparisons on patients with type 2 diabetes initiating second-line ADM therapy (ie, the first ADM other than metformin). Our analysis compared the cardiovascular effectiveness of the next ADM class started after metformin alone or no prior ADM: DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLT-2 inhibitors, TZDs, basal insulin, or sulfonylureas or meglitinides (both referred to as sulfonylureas hereafter). eTable 1 in the Supplement lists medications from each ADM class. The Northwestern University institutional review board deemed this study exempt from review and waived the need for patient informed consent.

Medical diagnoses were coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9),19 which was phased out in September 2015. Analyzing International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) data after that time would require differential ascertainment of outcomes and was therefore not performed. Pharmacy claims for individual second-line ADMs were grouped into 1 of the 6 classes. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values were available for a subset of patients based on their laboratory vendor. Information about patients’ race/ethnicity was imputed by the data vendor. The data are described in-depth elsewhere.20 We followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guidelines.21 Participants The study population was derived from a nationwide database of US adults 18 years or older who were enrolled in commercial or Medicare Advantage health insurance plans. Inclusion criteria were (1) type 2 diabetes and a first pharmacy-dispensing event for second-line ADMs, occurring on the index date; (2) at least 12 months of enrollment before the index date; (3) no ADM prescription fills other than metformin before the index date; and (4) at least 2 prescription fills of the index ADM, which identifies early persistent users.22 Individuals were considered to have type 2 diabetes if they had at least 1 medical claim associated with a corresponding diagnosis code occurring on or before the index date. We excluded patients with evidence of type 1 diabetes or secondary diabetes prior to the index date, more than 1 ADM class prescription filled on the index date, or pregnancy within 180 days before the index date or any time thereafter. Definitions of the eligibility criteria and study variables are provided in eTable 2 in the Supplement. Exposure and Outcomes The exposure was a categorical variable identifying which second-line ADM class was started on the index date, defined by the first prescription fill of the new ADM. The primary outcome was time to first major adverse cardiovascular event after starting the index ADM. Cardiovascular events were ascertained using diagnosis codes associated with inpatient medical claims, which are very specific and have higher positive predictive value for identifying events than ambulatory claims.23,24 The composite primary outcome included hospitalization for 1 of the following cardiovascular conditions: congestive heart failure, stroke, ischemic heart disease, and peripheral artery disease, which was added because a recent ADM trial reported increased amputation risk.8 We examined each of these events individually as secondary outcomes. History of cardiovascular events before the index date was ascertained in the same manner. Patients were censored after the first cardiovascular event (n = 3483), discontinuation of insurance coverage (n = 86 411), transition to ICD-10 (n = 7697), or 2 years of follow-up (n = 35 116). The last criterion was chosen to balance follow-up time across ADM groups given the introduction of SGLT-2 inhibitors in 2013. Covariates All covariates were assessed within the 12 months preceding the index date. Demographic data included patients’ age, sex, and race/ethnicity. The most recent HbA1c result was categorized: less than 8.0%, 8.0% to 10.0%, more than 10.0%, and a separate category for those without available values. We used diagnostic codes from inpatient and ambulatory medical claims to examine prevalent microvascular complications.25 The following cardiovascular risk factors were also assessed at baseline and analyzed as covariates: chronic kidney disease, dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, and tobacco use. We examined patient use of the following medications known to affect cardiovascular risk: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, aldosterone receptor antagonists, antiplatelet drugs, β-blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, statins, and other lipid-lowering drugs. Time-varying covariates were constructed to capture changes JAMA Network Open | Diabetes and Endocrinology Second-line Antidiabetic Medications and Cardiovascular Events in Adults With Type 2 Diabetes JAMA Network Open. 2018;1(8):e186125. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2018.6125 (Reprinted) December 21, 2018 3/15 Downloaded From:  on 12/21/2018 in the use of these medications during follow-up as well as exposure to other ADMs started after the index date. Characteristics of prescribers (ie, area of clinical training) and health coverage (ie, payer, plan type, enrollment year, census division where enrolled, and mean medical expenses for all plan members in the previous year) were also analyzed as covariates. Statistical Analysis Data analysis was performed from January 2017 to October 2018. Summary statistics characterized the study population by second-line ADM class (Table 1 and eTable 3 in the Supplement) and χ2 tests were used to examine associations between baseline covariates and index ADM class. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to model the association between index ADM class and composite cardiovascular events (Table 2). To test the proportional hazards assumption, we generated and compared log-log plots for the 6 ADM classes, and tested Schoenfeld residuals.26 The primary model included individual variables for all baseline patient characteristics listed in Table 1, in addition to prescribers’ area of clinical training and health coverage characteristics listed in eTable 3 in the Supplement. Direct-adjusted cumulative incidence curves from the primary model were plotted (Figure).27,28 Direct adjustment calculates a mean for the estimated survival curves for patients in each group rather than computing estimates at the mean value of the covariates. By using the same approach, individual cardiovascular events were modeled separately. The DPP-4 inhibitors served as the comparison group in all models, following trial evidence of their cardiovascular neutrality.5-7 The primary analysis followed an intention-to-treat principle intended to reflect “real-world” clinical practice. To assess the robustness of our findings, we conducted multiple sensitivity analyses. In the full cohort, we stratified the primary model by the presence of prior cardiovascular events, prior metformin use, and available HbA1c data (Table 3). Incomplete medication adherence or additional medications filled after the index date may have affected cardiovascular outcomes. Therefore, we conducted a sensitivity analysis accounting for time-varying exposure to all ADMs and cardiovascular medications filled during follow-up (Table 3). In addition, the subset of patients who were adherent to the index ADM, defined by possession of the medication for 80% or more of days,29 and filled no other ADM during follow-up was examined (Table 4). Other sensitivity analyses added to the primary model HbA1c values within the preceding 3 months (eTable 4 in the Supplement) and Charlson comorbidity score (eTable 5 in the Supplement). We also defined the index date based on the second fill of the index ADM (eTable 6 in the Supplement). We examined the association of ADM class with schizophrenia as a negative control outcome. Because there is no plausible mechanism by which ADMs are associated with schizophrenia risk, observed associations in this falsification test should be due to bias (eTable 7 in the Supplement). A 2-sided P value less than .05 was considered significant for all statistical testing. Analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc). Results The total study cohort included 132 737 insured adult patients with type 2 diabetes (men, 55%; aged 45 to 64 years, 58%; white, 63%). Table 1 reports statistically significant associations between index ADM class and all listed baseline characteristics of patients. There were clinically meaningful differences between ADM groups with respect to some sociodemographic factors, prevalent clinical conditions, and cardiovascular medication use. Overall, 5.5% of patients had a history of cardiovascular events before starting treatment with the index ADM. Sulfonylureas composed 47.6% of index ADM fills, followed by DPP-4 inhibitors (21.8%), basal insulin (12.2%), GLP-1 receptor agonists (8.6%), TZDs (5.6%), and SGLT-2 inhibitors (4.3%). Almost three-quarters of index ADMs were prescribed by physicians trained in internal medicine or family medicine (eTable 3 in the Supplement). There were 3480 inpatient cardiovascular events during 169 384 person-years of follow-up (mean [SD], 1.3 [0.6] years).

Table 2 and the Figure present the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of cardiovascular events for each second-line ADM class relative to DPP-4 inhibitors. Starting treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists was associated with a lower incidence of composite cardiovascular events (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.63-0.96). The cardiovascular event rates after starting treatment with SGLT-2 inhibitors (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.57-1.53) and TZDs (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.76-1.11) were not statistically different from DPP-4 inhibitors. The risk of composite cardiovascular events was 36% higher in the sulfonylureas group (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.23-1.49) and more than 2 times higher in the basal insulin group (HR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.81-2.27) than in the DPP-4 inhibitor group. This corresponds to numbers needed to harm during 2 years of treatment with sulfonylureas and basal insulin of 103 and 37, respectively. Increased relative cardiovascular risk associated with use of sulfonylureas or basal insulin was observed across all individual cardiovascular outcomes. Treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists was associated with a significant reduction in stroke risk (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.44-0.97). No other significant benefits of ADM class were observed for individual cardiovascular outcomes. In sensitivity analyses (Table 3), the increased cardiovascular risks associated with starting basal insulin or sulfonylurea treatment compared with DPP-4 inhibitors were robust.

In general, larger effect sizes were observed in the subgroup of patients who were 80% adherent and started treatment with no other ADMs during the follow-up period (Table 4). Other results from sensitivity analyses were substantively similar to the primary findings. In falsification testing, there were no significant associations between ADM class and schizophrenia (eTable 7 in the Supplement). Discussion In this large observational analysis of insured patients with type 2 diabetes who initiated second-line therapy, GLP-1 receptor agonist use was associated with significant reductions in the composite primary outcome compared with DPP-4 inhibitor use. However, this finding was not significant in some sensitivity analyses. There was a direction toward cardiovascular benefit among patients starting treatment with SGLT-2 inhibitors compared with DPP-4 inhibitors that did not achieve statistical significance. This study found consistent cardiovascular harms associated with use of basal insulin or sulfonylureas compared with DPP-4 inhibitors. Collectively, these findings raise concerns about the cardiovascular safety of sulfonylureas and basal insulin compared with newer ADMs and suggest that short-term cardiovascular outcomes of newer ADM classes may be similar among patients starting second-line treatment. After metformin, current guidelines recommend selecting ADMs based on expected glycemic improvements, potential risks, and other factors, such as their effect on body weight.2,4 Some experts suggest that clinicians also consider cardiovascular benefits and harms when prescribing second-line ADM therapy.15 However, limited cardiovascular data are currently available for the large population of patients starting second-line ADMs after metformin alone is not sufficient or not tolerated. Our analysis provides preliminary evidence needed by patients, clinicians, insurance plans, and pharmacy benefit managers to weigh the comparative cardiovascular harms and benefits of each second-line ADM class in this understudied population. Recent randomized clinical trial results (eTable 8 in the Supplement) provide some context for interpreting our findings. Although the trials used the highest level of methodologic rigor, they have limitations. First, the major cardiovascular outcome trials compared a single medication to placebo, Table 3.

Second, most participants had known cardiovascular disease, which affects only 18% of all US adults with diabetes.30 Therefore, trial findings may not apply to patients with a lower short-term risk of cardiovascular events.31 Future cardiovascular outcome trials in this broader population are unlikely because of the resources required, limited interest among funders, and the lack of a regulatory requirement to conduct such trials for older ADMs.32 Randomized clinical trials also may overestimate medication effects observed in clinical practice by selecting highly adherent participants and other study procedures that are not replicable during routine care.33 This context highlights an important role for observational research comparing the cardiovascular effectiveness of ADMs in more typical patients receiving medication in real-world conditions.34,35 Our findings will be complemented by an ongoing randomized clinical trial comparing the glucose-lowering effects of all ADMs studied here, except TZDs and SGLT-2 inhibitors, among participants who initiate second-line treatment after metformin monotherapy.36 When available, results from that ongoing trial will provide evidence about the glycemic efficacy of these drugs among adherent research volunteers and under ideal conditions. Our primary model showed significantly lower risk of composite cardiovascular events associated with GLP-1 receptor agonist use compared with DPP-4 inhibitor use. Improved cardiovascular outcomes among those who initiated treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists who did not take metformin previously, relative to those who did, may reflect time-lag bias with a longer duration of diabetes among metformin users. Recent placebo-controlled trials of semaglutide and liraglutide therapy also showed reductions in composite fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events.12,13 Like the semaglutide trial,13 this study found a significant decrease in the incidence of stroke among patients starting treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists. Reductions in stroke risk approached statistical significance in other GLP-1 receptor agonist trials despite not being designed to detect this outcome.10-12,37 Our analysis likely had greater statistical power because there was follow-up of many more patients receiving treatment than past cardiovascular outcome trials. Interestingly, none of the patients in our GLP-1 receptor agonist group filled a prescription of semaglutide (data not shown). Table 4.

Compared with DPP-4 inhibitors, we found no statistically significant cardiovascular benefit from SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy. Our analysis included relatively few data on SGLT-2 inhibitors because of their introduction in 2013. Therefore, including longer follow-up in this group may have increased statistical power to detect significant cardiovascular benefits from these medications. Treatment with SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists has shown improvements in mortality and some individual cardiovascular events among trial participants with a high burden of cardiovascular disease.14 Prior observational analyses that included patients taking sulfonylureas or insulin in their comparison groups have generally reached similar findings.38-42 If sulfonylureas and insulin are more harmful than other ADMs, this finding may have accentuated estimates of comparative cardiovascular benefit associated with GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors. Furthermore, observational analyses examining the subgroup of patients without prior cardiovascular disease reported smaller or no benefits on composite cardiovascular outcomes when initiating treatment with these 2 drug classes, which is more similar to our findings.38,39 Finally, most previous research included Europeans, whose cardiovascular outcomes may differ from this US cohort. Sulfonylureas constituted almost half of the second-line ADM prescriptions in our cohort, which is comparable with prior reports.43 We found increased cardiovascular risk with sulfonylureas compared with DPP-4 inhibitors, which was robust across all analyses. This risk is consistent with a large number observational studies describing cardiovascular harms of sulfonylureas, many of which were conducted before statins were widely used in diabetes care.44 Our comparison of sulfonylureas with all newer ADMs in the poststatin era shows continued widespread use despite comparatively greater cardiovascular harms. We also found that basal insulin treatment was associated with higher cardiovascular risk than DPP-4 inhibitor treatment. Recent trials studying insulin as part of intensive diabetes treatment have reported conflicting findings on cardiovascular outcomes.45 However, a large body of research reveals common mechanisms linking basal insulin and sulfonylureas with increased cardiovascular risk, namely, hyperinsulinemia, weight gain, and hypoglycemia.45-47 Hypoglycemia may be most important for short-term cardiovascular outcomes.48 Despite the observed cardiovascular harms associated with initiating sulfonylureas and basal insulin, prescriptions for these 2 ADM classes were filled by 60% of patients in our nationwide analysis. The cardiovascular effects of TZDs have been debated for many years,49-53 and we found no significant associations in this group. Strengths and Limitations To our knowledge, this is the first study comparing cardiovascular outcomes among initiators of all major second-line ADM. Examining a large, population-based, nationwide cohort enabled the ascertainment of sufficient cardiovascular events to perform this current analysis. Our study design provided adequate power to examine stroke as an individual outcome, which was not possible in clinical trials with smaller numbers of participants receiving treatment. Our rates of nonfatal cardiovascular events were comparable with those observed in the UK Prospective Diabetes Study and prior analyses of similar populations.54-56 The consistency of this study’s findings across multiple cardiovascular outcomes, modeling approaches, and subpopulations supports its internal validity. Our observational design also captured real-world conditions that randomized clinical trials do not, which promotes generalizability of the results in diverse US practice settings. This analysis is also timely, providing data on all major ADMs in a contemporary context where prescribers have little available cardiovascular evidence to inform initiation of second-line therapy. Our study also has limitations. Patients were required to fill the index ADM at least twice, which was chosen to represent a level of exposure that has been associated with cardiovascular outcomes.8,9,12,13 This requirement may have introduced bias if reasons for discontinuation after the first fill were correlated with cardiovascular outcomes.57 Although this is likely not the case for most ADMs studied here,2 the systematic exclusion of some patients with early discontinuation of JAMA Network Open | Diabetes and Endocrinology Second-line Antidiabetic Medications and Cardiovascular Events in Adults With Type 2 Diabetes JAMA Network Open. 2018;1(8):e186125. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2018.6125 (Reprinted) December 21, 2018 9/15 Downloaded From:  on 12/21/2018 sulfonylureas and basal insulin owing to hypoglycemia may have underestimated the cardiovascular harms reported.58,59 We analyzed administrative claims data, which may be prone to misclassification and do not include granular information used by clinicians when prescribing second- line ADMs. Medical record data, which may contain some of these factors, have been used in similar studies but were not available in our data source.60 Nonrandomized studies like ours are also prone to selection bias. Multivariable adjustment for observed differences in cardiovascular risk among ADM groups, as well as falsification testing to address potential unobserved confounders, were approaches used to mitigate selection bias.61 Propensity score matching was not used because it would have limited statistical power for comparing 6 ADM groups,62 especially those with relatively smaller numbers of patients. Like similar observational studies, we had no body weight data. Although we used diagnosis codes to ascertain obesity identically for all ADM groups, this strategy underestimates its true prevalence and lacks detail about obesity severity.63 Our data sources included HbA1c values for one-third of the study population, which represents a proportion comparable to similar cohort studies using claims data.64 Compared with patients who had no HbA1c data, those with available values were younger with a higher burden of other cardiovascular risk factors (eTable 9 in the Supplement). However, the cardiovascular effectiveness of ADM classes was similar in these 2 subpopulations (Table 3). Furthermore, adjustment for HbA1c in the primary model did not change our findings, which supports a growing consensus that short- term cardiovascular events are not primarily mediated by glycemic control and its association with atherosclerosis progression.65 A large body of research has identified other mechanisms that may explain the short-term association of ADM with cardiovascular outcomes.48,50,66-70 Although the mean duration of follow-up in our was 1.3 years, this represents a comparable or longer time interval than other recent observational analyses of second-line ADMs.38,39,41,71 We also had no information on diabetes duration, which is an important determinant of cardiovascular risk.72 However, our selection of patients who were early in their medical treatment of diabetes was intended to compare those at a similar disease stage. In addition, all analyses adjusted for individual cardiovascular risk factors and evidence of existing microvascular and macrovascular complications that are a proxy for diabetes duration. Because we selected patients at a relatively early point in their pharmacologic management of diabetes, our findings may not apply to patients who have a longer duration of diabetes, are already taking multiple ADMs, or have a higher risk of cardiovascular events. Such populations have been studied elsewhere.5-14,38-42,71 Our data source did not allow us to examine mortality, hindering comparisons with studies that assessed fatal cardiovascular events. We did not analyze individual drugs within ADM classes or total costs of diabetes care. These are important directions for future research. Conclusions Among the large population of insured adult patients with type 2 diabetes who initiated second-line antidiabetic medication therapy, an increased risk of cardiovascular events was associated with starting sulfonylureas or basal insulin treatment compared with newer ADM alternatives. Therefore, clinicians may consider prescribing GLP-1 receptor agonists, DPP-4 inhibitors, or SGLT-2 inhibitors more routinely after metformin rather than sulfonylureas or basal insulin. Furthermore, our findings may suggest a role for these newer ADMs in managing cardiovascular risk among patients with type 2 diabetes who either are taking metformin alone or have received no ADM previously. Although our findings should be interpreted with some caution due to the observational design of this study, they were robust to several rigorous sensitivity analyses and are supported by prior mechanistic and clinical evidence. Future research should compare ADM classes on glycemic effectiveness and additional metabolic end points.

Coronary artery calcium scoring (CCS) is a marker of subclinical  CAD risk, which has been shown in observational studies to provide prognostic information  that is incremental to clinical assessment, is relatively inexpensive and performed with a  small radiation dose. However, the use of CCS in guiding prevention is not strongly  supported by guidelines. Showing definitive evidence of the efficacy and cost-effectiveness  of CCS is therefore of importance.  Study design: The proposed randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the use of CCS, will be  targeted to 40-70 year old 1st degree relatives of patients with CAD onset <60 years old, or  2nd degree relatives of patients with onset <50 years old. Control patients will undergo  standard risk scoring and be blinded to CCS results. In the intervention group, primary  prevention in patients undergoing CCS will be informed by this score. At three years,  effectiveness will be assessed on change in plaque volume at CT coronary angiography  (CTCA), the extent of which has been strongly linked to outcome.  Summary: The CAUGHT-CAD trial will provide evidence to inform the guidelines  regarding the place of CCS in decision-making regarding primary prevention of patients with  a FHx.  Keywords. Coronary calcium score, prevention, family history, coronary artery disease.  ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 3      Rationale  The frequency of all ischemic heart disease endpoints is increased in relatives of patients with  documented CAD. In the Framingham study, a family history of premature CAD (FHx) doubled the  odds of CAD (1), and among 5347 asymptomatic individuals in the Multi-Ethnic Study of  Atherosclerosis (MESA), the odds of a coronary calcium score (CCS) >0 was increased 1.94 times  (95% CI, 1.64 to 2.29 odds) by FHx, independent of age, gender, and race (2). However, FHx has not  been included in most CAD risk scores (3), with few exceptions (4), for a variety of reasons. First, the  need for parsimony in risk assessment algorithms – although FHx is associated with co-exposure to  treatable risks (such as poor diet choices or passive smoking) within the family environment, and also  potentially accounts for genetic contributions to the other classical risk factors. Second, the scores  have focused on 5 and 10–year risk, while FHx seems to have most impact on lifetime risk (5). Third,  there has been a focus on traditional risk factors (smoking, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and  hypertension), which together with abdominal obesity, psychosocial factors, and diet and physical  activity account for 90% or more of population-attributable risk of myocardial infarction (6). Fourth,  the reclassification of risk with FHx has been considered of borderline value in the population context  (7); environment-based risk factors outweighing the contribution of genetic risk factors in population  attributable risk (8).   Failure to incorporate FHx in risk assessment may lead to under-treatment of those with a FHx at  intermediate risk - and overtreatment of similar subjects with no FHx (9). In this situation, CCS may  be a useful additional risk marker (10), especially in individuals deemed at low risk by existing  assessment measures (1). A meta-analysis of 32 studies linking measures of subclinical  atherosclerosis recently showed a significant relationship between these markers and FHx of CAD,  independent of traditional risk factors (11).  These features support a more active approach in patients  with a FHx. There are two ways of addressing this. First, to compensate for the effect of FHx,  guidelines in some jurisdictions have proposed lower treatment thresholds, which is consistent with an  approach of tailoring the intensity of primary prevention strategies to the risk of coronary events (12).  The problem is that there is no consensus on treatment thresholds – which currently range from a 10  ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 4      year absolute risk as low as 7.5% in the most recent US guidelines (3), through to 20% in the UK  guidelines (13) and 30% in New Zealand (14). This variation reflects various degrees of enthusiasm  for treating an intermediate risk group (2–10% 5-year risk) in whom pharmacological or lifestyle  interventions may show only modest returns (15).   Another way of resolving the conundrum of FHx would be to seek evidence of subclinical  atherosclerosis in order to further stratify risk levels (16). Detection of subclinical CAD using  coronary calcium score (CCS) is feasible and reliable, has been extensively studied in risk evaluation  in primary prevention, and is more predictive of outcome than alternative tests such as carotid intima- medial thickness (17). However, CCS has not been incorporated as a routine in the guidelines, and  most young patients with a positive CCS score do not satisfy criteria for lipid-lowering therapy by  global risk scoring. In 2611 asymptomatic participants aged 30-65 years in the Dallas Heart Study, the  use of non-invasive atherosclerosis imaging resulted in bidirectional reclassification of eligibility for  lipid-lowering therapy, with 6.3% of subjects being reclassified as being not at goal and 2.7% as being  at goal (18). In a median follow-up of 7.6 years in the MESA study, 55% of incident events  (myocardial infarction, angina resulting in revascularization, resuscitated cardiac arrest, stroke, CV  death) occurred in the 21% of participants with CCS ≥100, even though 65% of events occurred in  participants with 0 or 1 lipid abnormalities (7). This evidence supports the role of CCS for predicting  risk, but the evidence in favor of CCS providing an outcome benefit is currently limited. Accordingly,  we developed a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to demonstrate whether the use of CCS to select  intermediate-risk subjects with a FHx for primary prevention, altered the progression and outcome of  CAD.     Study design and objectives  Design. The CAUGHT-CAD study (Coronary Artery calcium score: Use to Guide management of  HerediTary CAD); ACTRN 12614001294640, https://www.anzctr.org.au/ ) is an RCT that seeks to  evaluate the utility of CCS in intermediate-risk subjects with a FHx who do not satisfy current  ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 5      Australian guidelines for primary prevention. The primary endpoint will be change of coronary plaque  volume at 3 years, and the secondary endpoint will be outcome after 9 years.  Support. The CAUGHT-CAD trial (Coronary Artery calcium score: Use to Guide management of  Hereditary Coronary Artery Disease) is supported in part by a Project Grant from the National Health  and Medical Research Council, Canberra, Australia. The authors are solely responsible for the design  and conduct of this study, all study analyses, the drafting and editing of the paper and its final  contents.  Patient selection. Asymptomatic subjects age 40-70 years old with a FHx of CAD involving an index  patient <60y (1st degree) or <50y (2nd degree) who are not already on statins, who have a total  cholesterol (TC) <6.5 mmol/L and LDLC <5 mmol/L, and who have a 5 year risk >2% using the  Australian risk calculator. This calculates absolute 5-year risk of coronary heart disease and stroke (in  contrast to 10 year coronary risk from the Framingham calculator) from age, sex, smoking status,  blood pressure, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, diabetes mellitus and ECG evidence of  left ventricular hypertrophy (http://www.cvdcheck.org.au/), using an equation based on data from the  Framingham Study.   Subjects are excluded if they are already on statins (or intolerant to statins), or have symptomatic  vascular disease (for which statins would be indicated), pre-existing muscle disease (as this may be  confused with myalgia from statins), atrial fibrillation (which interferes with CTCA), or chronic  kidney disease on hemodialysis (because of vascular calcification). Groups unable to provide  informed consent, or with major systemic illness limiting life expectancy are excluded, as are women  of child-bearing potential. Of note, statins are prescribed as “usual care” for Australian patients with  diabetes mellitus (DM) in the presence of total cholesterol >5.5 mmol/L, age >60 years old,  microalbuminuria or of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander origin, and consequently patients in these  categories are excluded – however, all other patients with DM are eligible for randomization.  In all cases, the first step is a standard clinical history (19) and risk evaluation using the Australian  risk calculator. Low (<2% 5-year risk) and high risk patients (>10% 5-year risk) are excluded and  referred for management. The remainder undergo CCS.  ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 6      Clinical evaluation. Baseline measures include a survey of health behavior, chronic illnesses and  medications and socio-demographic factors; measures of health-related and CVD-specific quality of  life, depression and anxiety (5,20); a 6 minute walk test; BMI and waist circumference measures, and  systolic and diastolic BP. The following investigations are undertaken at baseline profiling; fasting  lipid profile, glucose, high-sensitive C-reactive protein, creatinine, creatine kinase, liver function tests  and full blood count.  Coronary CT. CCS are performed on a dual source 128 slice CT machines, equipped with radiation  dose reduction systems and appropriate reconstruction algorithms.  Images are performed at a  temporal resolution of 330msec and spatial resolution 0.24mm. The estimated radiation dose for  calcium score is approximately 1mSv (dose length product 90mGycm). The Agatston score,  performed on standard commercial workstations, is used to stratify groups with CCS >0 and <100 and  100-400 (Figure 1).  Eligible patients (CCS >0 and <400) undergo a CTCA (for baseline plaque volume and exclusion of  serious CAD). Excellent image quality is essential for plaque volume measurement. Acquisitions are  not performed at heart-rates >65/minute (the target is <60/minute). Patients are prepared with oral  metoprolol, and additional oral and/or intravenous beta-blockade may be administered to further  lower the heart rate. In patients intolerant of beta blockers, verapamil or ivabradine are used. CTCA  will also be performed on the same CT system, with temporal resolution reduced to 165 msec during  CTCA acquisition. The estimated radiation dose for full CTCA varies according to patient size and  heart rate, but is routinely ~2 mSv (21).   After CT, patients with a score of 0 (low risk, who do not require specific therapy) are excluded, as  are those with a score >400 (who are at risk of significant coronary stenosis), or with serious  obstructive disease by CTCA (Figure 1).  Randomisation. Subjects are centrally randomized using the Data Management Centre, with a 1:1  ratio of CCS-guided and usual care (CCS blinded). As CCS may be a determinant of progression  and risk, randomization as stratified by groups with CCS<100 and 100-400 (Figure 1).   ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 7      Therapy. In usual care, subjects will undergo standardized education about CAD prevention and risk  management will be undertaken by the patient’s physician, blinded to the evaluation of CCS. This will  involve weight control, treatment of dysglycemia and hypertension to target, and lipid management in  accordance with current national criteria. In some instances, statins may be started – based on the  physician’s evaluation of risk – but this is expected to be uncommon.  In CCS-guided care, all participants will undergo tailored health profiling to define individual  modifiable risk factors and the delivery of clearly articulated health care goals. This standardized  intervention will include: supporting lifestyle and risk modification (individualized nutrition, weight  and physical activity goals), encouraging active self-management of risk (one-on-one counseling and  education, including use of the CCS image to facilitate discussion) and improving coordination of  care between subjects’ healthcare providers (e.g. primary care, pharmacists etc) to achieve individual  goals for optimal risk and disease management.  In the CCS-guided arm, participants with a CCS>0 are treated with atorvastatin 40 mg/d, based on the  recommendation of moderate-high intensity statin in patients with >7.5% 10-year risk in the  guidelines (3), and are not treated to target. Given the planned screening measures, intolerance (eg.  myalgia) at this dose was expected to be <5%. In the presence of myalgia, the dose is reduced to 20  mg, and if unsuccessful, by a switch to rosuvastatin or pravastatin, with dose reduction if necessary. If  all steps are unsuccessful, the drug is stopped and the subject retained in the trial with follow-up on  grounds of intention to treat. Other therapy indicated by standard primary prevention guidelines (e.g.  anti-hypertensives) will also be initiated. Follow-up is arranged at one month (phone or e-mail  according to preference) to review the efficacy of the self-care plan and prescribed statin therapy. A  face-to-face meeting at three months reviews longer-term risk management.  Endpoints. The primary end-point is absolute change in total coronary plaque volume after 36  months after CCS, assessed by an independent core laboratory.   Baseline and follow-up plaque volume studies will be blindly compared in the core laboratory using a  workstation for 3-dimensional image analysis. Volume rendering and curved multi-planar reformats  are used to evaluate the coronary vessels. Vessels >2 mm diameter will be assessed for the presence  of plaque. Images undergo semi-automated image extraction using proprietary software. After  ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 8      identifying the plaque area, we use an automated plaque detection tool to quantify plaque volume on  both baseline and follow-up scans (22,23). The automated software detects outer vessel wall and  lumen and the intervening plaque, but in each case, we manually adjust borders of the vessel wall and  lumen to optimize and confirm software estimates. In cases of mixed plaque phenotype, we also  manually adjust the borders to correctly separate calcified from non-calcified components. The  software then provides volume of both components of mixed plaques. Low attenuation plaque is  identified as plaque with attenuation <30 HU. This technique has been previously published (24).  Inter- and intra-observer variability has been published previously, but will be assessed on 10% of  scans.  Secondary endpoints will be: MACE (death, myocardial infarction, stroke) after 9 years, symptom  status, health-related quality-of-life (health state utility values), health resource consumption,  including hospitalization and data-linkage to administrative data. These data will inform a model to  assess cost-effectiveness.  Safety. Every opportunity will be taken to ensure that significant CAD is actioned - the study will be  restricted to CCS<400 and the presence of left main involvement at CTCA will lead to notification of  the subject’s physician and appropriate investigation. Extracardiac findings will also be investigated  in all subjects. However, no other cardiac interventions are planned in control patients. CT findings  will be made available to all subjects at the end of the study.  Radiation safety is an important consideration. The use of prospective gating has permitted a radiation  dose of 2mSv, analogous to a year’s background radiation in Australia, and a fatal cancer risk  (assuming linearity of risk) of 1:10,000.   The main anticipated side-effect of statin therapy is myalgia. Adverse events (AEs) and serious  adverse events (SAEs) are identified at follow-up. A Data Safety and Monitoring Board, led by an  experienced clinician, will review the safety findings at the end of each year. All endpoints will be  blindly adjudicated (including determination of probable causality). While it is unlikely that there will  be events in the study time-frame that justify stopping, we will use the Haybittle-Peto stopping rule at  a p=0.001.   ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 9      Data Collection and Management. Standardized data acquisition is obtained using Case Report  Forms. Data capture, analyses and archiving are coordinated through a secure web-based database and  electronic capture of paper-based CRFs. Assessments will be undertaken at a series of mandatory  time-points with a window of one month either side of the scheduled visit to permit flexible  scheduling (Table 1). Independent study monitors will verify 5% of study data against source  documents.   Statistical Analyses All data will be pooled and summarized with respect to demographic and  baseline characteristics. Exploratory data analyses will be performed using descriptive statistics.   The primary analysis will compare the 3-year coronary plaque volume in CCS-guided and usual care  subjects. We will use linear mixed models to correct for coincidental between-group differences  despite randomization, and to obtain the effect size of CCS-based management, independent of age,  sex and baseline risk. The same methods will be used for the secondary end-points. The primary  analysis will be on grounds of intention-to-treat (ITT), but we will also perform a per-protocol  analysis.  Events are expected to be very rare. Nonetheless, differences between groups with respect to the  number and/or timing of events will be assessed using survival curves for all-cause and event-free  survival. Cox-Proportional Hazards Models will be used to examine the independent effect of  treatment and risk factors on outcomes.  Sample size calculations. Power calculations have been based on the following observations. Prior  observational studies have suggested that the difference between statin treated and untreated patients  with regard to change in coronary plaque volume is in the range of 40-60 mm3. In a CAD screening  population, approximately 50% of whom had a FHx of CAD, baseline noncalcified plaque was in the  range of 315 mm3 and low attenuation plaque of 95 mm3, statins reduced noncalcified plaque volume  by 47±72 mm3 (vs control 14±77, p<0.001) and low attenuation plaque by 12±19 mm3 (vs control  6±23, p<0.0001) over 12 months (24). In contrast, a virtual histology-intravascular ultrasound study  of 172 CAD patients showed atheroma volumes of 152±132 mm3 with CCS=0, 171±114 mm3 with  CCS 1-100, and 195±149 mm3 with CCS 101-400. Respective low attenuation plaque volumes were  15±18, 20±19 and 23±19 (25). Accordingly, we have powered this study for a delta plaque volume of  ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 10      20 mm3, to allow for smaller differences in progression rates between the groups than in prior  observational reports (Table 2). Previous work has shown CCS exclusion criteria (0 and >400) in 30%  of intermediate risk patients with FHx of CAD (2). We have therefore determined that 638 patients  will need to undergo serial imaging to have 80% power to detect a difference between the groups of  20 mm3, with a standard deviation of 90 mm3 (two-sided =0.05). Assuming that 15% of subjects will  drop out or not have evaluable imaging at both time points, 734 subjects will be randomized over the  1st 18 months of the study, to provide a minimum 3 year follow-up. Other scenarios (involving larger  change in plaque volume or smaller variances) may enable appropriate analysis to be performed with  a smaller sample size (Table 2).  Based on a previous non-randomized study of patients with FHx and CC (29), we expect 9 year event  rates of 14 vs 25%, and 540 patients would have a 90% power to show a difference at p=0.05.  Cost-effectiveness analysis. An economic analysis will be undertaken to assess the cost-effectiveness  of CCS guided primary prevention of CVD from a health care payer’s perspective. The incremental  cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for CCS guided prevention compared with routine care will be  calculated based on a Markov Model. The model will be informed by observed transition probabilities  between health states, and costs and health state utility values assessed during the trial. Uncertainty  will be assessed through a Monte Carlo simulation, enabling the calculation of a confidence interval  for the ICER.    Preliminary data.  The most common source of recruitment has been direct from the community – especially large  workplaces – and in response to media advertisements seeking the involvement of asymptomatic  subjects with a FHx. Smaller numbers have originated from family members of patients with  premature CAD attending inpatient or outpatient clinics, from lipid specialists and primary care –  including searches of electronic health records.  The first 500 scanned patients had a mean age of 59±8 years, 53% were women, and the 5 year risk  was 5±3%) (Table 3). From 40-70 year-old subjects with a family history, and without  exclusion criteria, there was a screening failure rate of 51%. The most common causes were  ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 11      low risk (24%), high risk (17%), or because the participant decided not to proceed with  recruitment, including because of radiation safety concerns (10%).  CCS ranged from 0 to >2000; 51% had a score of 0, but few had a score >400. Subjects with a score  of <100 accounted for >50% of those randomized (Figure 2). Plaque volume (89±81ml) was  calculated in all subjects, being 57mm3 and 138mm3 in lower and upper CCS groups, respectively.  CCS>0 was associated with age, but not age of onset in the patient’s relative, BP, lipid profile or BMI  (Table 4).  These findings emphasize that half of a priori intermediate-risk, middle-aged subjects with a FHx of  premature CAD have a CCS=0, conferring low risk a posteriori. This finding suggests that the current  guidance regarding lower threshold for primary prevention intervention may not be beneficial in the  majority of patients with a FHx.  Context  The CAUGHT-CAD trial seeks to define the value of assessing CCS in patients with a FHx and a  priori intermediate-risk of CAD as a means of identifying a subclinical subgroup that would  preferentially benefit from primary preventative therapy. The primary outcome is change in plaque  volume, but we will study the impact of CT-based intervention on outcomes over a decade.   CCS and primary prevention. CCS is known to be an important predictor of outcome in primary  prevention. For example, a classic study of >25,000 consecutive asymptomatic subjects, showed the  association of CCS with outcome, irrespective of other risk factors (26). Indeed, the addition of CCS  to traditional risk factors improved the area under the ROC curves, from 0.61 to 0.81 (p<0.0001), a  finding confirmed in other studies (27). A score of zero was identified in 44% of individuals, who had  an event rate of 0.6% over 12-years - a finding also independent of other risk factors. A CCS ≥300  Agatston units or ≥75 percentile for age, sex, and ethnicity has been proposed to facilitate decisions  regarding lipid-lowering management in intermediate-risk subjects (3).  However, it remains unproven that this risk assessment strategy changes outcome. This could be  achieved in two ways – by facilitating selection and/or facilitating adherence with preventive therapy.  ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 12      Showing subjects their CCS is strongly associated with subjects initiating therapy (28) and in a  systematic review of eight non-randomised studies (n=2,994) evaluating the use of CCS in improving  adherence to therapy, Rodondi et al (29) found that subjects with evidence of atherosclerosis showed  better perception of cardiovascular risk and improved adherence to lifestyle advice. However, in four  RCTs (n=709), screening did not influence risk for poorer outcomes, with the exception, in one study,  of improved smoking cessation (18% vs. 6%, p=0.03). The results of one negative RCT may be  particularly instructive (30); in a post hoc analysis, it suggested that targeted intervention in patients  with a FHx improved event-free survival in 1000 patients (age 59±6 years) with follow-up over 4.3  years (31). The findings support the role of patient selection in screening, and hints at a specific  indication for patients with a FHx. Indeed, the appropriate use criteria for cardiac CT lists the use of  CCS in low risk patients with a FHx as being appropriate (32).    Identifying response. The long-term benefits of CCS-guided therapy are likely to be attributable to  reduction of plaque volume by appropriate therapy. The progression of coronary atherosclerotic  burden measured by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is linked to adverse cardiovascular events (33);  each standard deviation increase in change in percent atheroma volume was associated with a 1.20- fold greater risk for MACE. The use of coronary CT to measure total plaque burden has been well  validated. In a recent meta-analysis of 42 studies (n=1360, 75% men; mean 59 years), no significant  difference was found between CTCA and IVUS measurements of vessel lumen cross-sectional area,  plaque area, percentage of area stenosis, or plaque volume. CTCA had 93% sensitivity and 92%  specificity for the detection of any plaque compared with IVUS. The same was true in eight studies of  plaque volume in studies using automated measurement techniques (34). However, while CCS acts as  the trigger for therapy, because of the cofounding effects of statins on CCS this is not itself a suitable  endpoint.  Coronary lesions associated with a large plaque burden and a small luminal area are the most likely to  be associated with acute events (35). In a study of 1584 patients with suspected CAD undergoing  CTCA, and followed for a median 5.5 years, non-obstructive lesions were associated with a 2.5-fold  increased hazard (similar to that of 1- and 2-vessel stenosis) with 35 of 794 (4%) patients having  events (36). Similarly, in 347 among 20,000 patients with suspected CAD in the international  ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 13      CONFIRM (Coronary CT Angiography EvaluatioN For Clinical Outcomes: An InteRnational  Multicenter) registry who died over a median follow-up of 2.3 years, the CTCA parameters most  associated with outcome were proximal mixed or calcified plaques and stenoses >50% (37).  Limitations. The exclusion of participants with CCS=0 means that the study is limited to  patients with calcified plaque. An alternative protocol would have been to include patients  with a CCS=0, which would have captured patients with noncalcified plaque. We decided  against this design as it would have required performance of CTCA for plaque burden in  more than twice as many patients – which would have increased the cost of the trial and as  well as the radiation burden to a degree that we found hard to justify in the context of the  very low risk in this group and the infrequent finding of noncalcified plaque with CCS=0.  However, we will follow all patients for endpoints at 9 years.  Conclusion. Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains a major cause of premature death and disability,  and cost-effective primary prevention depends on accurately evaluating CAD risk. Although most  new presentations with CAD involve new symptoms (eg. angina), >20% of initial presentations are  with a sudden catastrophic event such as infarction, stroke or even sudden cardiac death (38). This  study will be the first randomized trial of the value of CCS as assessed by CTCA for facilitating  decision-making to optimize the control of atherosclerosis in asymptomatic individuals at  intermediate risk and with a FHx of CAD.

The Resolute Onyx stent was developed to improve  visibility while reducing strut thickness, which was achieved by using a novel composite wire with a dense platinum– iridium core and an outer cobalt–chromium layer. We did the first randomised clinical trial to assess the safety and  efficacy of this often-used stent compared with the Orsiro stent, which consists of ultrathin cobalt–chromium struts. Methods We did an investigator-initiated, assessor-blinded and patient-blinded, randomised non-inferiority trial in  an allcomers population at seven independently monitored centres in Belgium, Israel, and the Netherlands. Eligible  participants were aged 18 years or older and required percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents.  After guide wire passage with or without predilation, members of the catheterisation laboratory team used web- based computer-generated allocation sequences to randomly assign patients (1:1) to either the Resolute Onyx or the  Orsiro stent. Randomisation was stratified by sex and diabetes status. Patients and assessors were masked to  allocated stents, but treating clinicians were not. The primary endpoint was target vessel failure at 1 year, a composite  of cardiac death, target-vessel-related myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularisation, and was assessed by  intention to treat (non-inferiority margin 2·5%) on the basis of outcomes adjudicated by an independent event  committee. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02508714. Findings Between Oct 7, 2015, and Dec 23, 2016, 2516 patients were enrolled, 2488 of whom were included in the  intention-to-treat analysis (28 withdrawals or screening failures). 1243 participants were assigned to the Resolute Onyx  group, and 1245 to the Orsiro group. Overall, 1765 (70·9%) participants presented with acute coronary syndromes and  1275 (51·2%) had myocardial infarctions. 1-year follow-up was available for 2478 (99·6%) patients. The primary endpoint  was met by 55 (4·5%) patients in the Resolute Onyx group and 58 (4·7%) in the Orsiro group. Non-inferiority of  Resolute Onyx to Orsiro was thus established (absolute risk difference –0·2% [95% CI –1·9 to 1·4]; upper limit of the  one-sided 95% CI 1·1%; pnon-inferiority=0·0005). Definite or probable stent thrombosis occurred in one (0·1%) participant in  the Resolute Onyx group and nine (0·7%) in the Orsiro group (hazard ratio 0·11 [95% CI 0·01–0·87]; p=0·0112). Interpretation The Resolute Onyx stent was non-inferior to Orsiro for a combined safety and efficacy endpoint at  1-year follow-up in allcomers. The low event rate in both groups suggests that both stents are safe, and the very low  rate of stent thrombosis in the Resolute Onyx group warrants further clinical investigation.

Introduction First-generation drug-eluting stents were associated with  an increased risk of stent thrombosis,1,2 and were thus  replaced by newer devices that deliver antiproliferative  drugs from more biocompatible coatings.3–6 These newer- generation drug-eluting stents are as efficacious as  first-generation stents in prevention of lesion recurrence  after percutaneous coronary intervention and have better  safety profiles in broad patient populations.7 Most  contemporary stents have platforms made from a cobalt– chromium alloy, which permits the creation of fine  mesh tubes with satisfactory radial force but has poor  radiographic visibility. Suboptimal radiographic visibility  can be challenging in patients who are obese, when  treating bifurcated or calcified coronary lesions, or when  assessing stent expansion.

It has a novel thin  strut composite wire stent platform that is covered with  the same zotarolimus-eluting durable polymer coating as  its predecessors.8–13 The metallic stent platform consists of  a composite wire made from a dense platinum–iridium  core, which makes the struts radiopaque, and an outer  layer of cobalt–chromium alloy. The dense core also allows  for reduced strut thickness, which might be associated  with a decreased risk of stent thrombosis.14,15 A wide range  of stent diameters are available.16,17 The availability of well  fitted stents could help to prevent suboptimal stent  expansion in very small vessels18 and to avoid incomplete  stent apposition in large vessels—both of which are risk  factors for stent thrombosis.19 Resolute Onyx is used to  treat all types of patients and lesion anatomies, but no  randomised clinical trial has ever been done to assess its  performance in an allcomers population. A head-to-head comparison of the Resolute Onyx stent  and the bioresorbable polymer-coated sirolimus-eluting  Orsiro stent (Biotronik, Bülach, Switzerland) would be  of interest, because the Orsiro stent, with its ultrathin  cobalt–chromium strut platform,6,17 has shown excellent  efficacy and safety outcomes in several randomised  trials.12,20–22 Most recently, in the randomised BIOFLOW  V trial,22 Orsiro outperformed a fluoropolymer-coated  cobalt–chromium everolimus-eluting stent at 1-year  follow-up. In the BIONYX trial, we compared the safety  and efficacy of the Resolute Onyx and Orsiro stents in  an allcomers population at 1-year follow-up. Methods Study design and participants We did a randomised, prospective, investigator- initiated, patient-blinded and assessor-blinded study at  seven specialised cardiac centres with expertise in  percutaneous coronary intervention in the Netherlands,  Belgium, and Israel (appendix). The trial design has  been pre viously reported.23 Eligible patients were aged  18 years or older and required percutaneous coronary  intervention. All types of coronary syndromes, coronary  artery and bypass lesions, and de-novo and restenotic  lesions were eligible for inclusion, and there was no  limit for lesion length, reference size, and number of  lesions or diseased vessels to be treated, as long as all  lesions were suitable for treatment with both stent  types according to the operator’s judgment. Exclusion  criteria are in the appendix.23 All patients provided  written informed consent. The study complied with the  CONSORT 2010 Statement and Declaration of Helsinki  and was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee  Twente and the institutional review boards of all  participating centres. Randomisation and masking Participants were enrolled in the catheterisation  laboratory by the operators who did the interventional  Research in context Evidence before this study We searched PubMed with the terms “coronary” AND “stent”  in combination with one or more of “sirolimus”, “zotarolimus”,  “Resolute Onyx”, “Orsiro”, “randomised”, and “randomized”  for complete reports of randomised trials comparing the  durable polymer-coated zotarolimus-eluting Resolute Onyx  stent with the bioresorbable polymer-coated sirolimus-eluting  Orsiro stent or with other stents, published in any language up  to July 18, 2018. We also checked the listings of the EuroPCR,  European Society of Cardiology, Transcatheter Cardiovascular  Therapeutics, and American College of Cardiology  Conferences. Previously, the Resolute Onyx stent had been  assessed in an angiographic endpoint study of 75 patients  with 8 months of follow-up and in two registry studies, one of  which examined 101 US and Japanese patients with up the  moderate risk who were treated with 2·00 mm Resolute Onyx  stents, and the other of which examined 402 Korean patients  with acute myocardial infarction. In previous studies, the  Orsiro stent was non-inferior to a durable polymer-coated  everolimus-eluting stent with respect to a primary  angiographical endpoint (BIOFLOW-II), and to a durable  polymer-coated everolimus-eluting stent (BIOSCIENCE),  an early biodegradable polymer-coated biolimus-eluting stent  (SORT OUT VII), and durable polymer-coated  zotarolimus-eluting cobalt-chromium stents (BIO-RESORT) in  treating allcomers. In a randomised clinical trial in  most-comers (BIOFLOW V), Orsiro outperformed (in terms of  the primary endpoint, target lesion failure) a durable  polymer-coated cobalt–chromium everolimus-eluting stent at  1-year follow-up. Resolute Onyx and Orsiro stents have not  previously been compared in a randomised trial. Additionally,  the Resolute Onyx stent has not been assessed in allcomers or  been compared with any other drug-eluting stent. Added value of this study Our analysis shows that treatment with the Resolute Onyx stent  and the Orsiro stent was similarly efficacious and safe, with  excellent 1-year clinical outcomes in an allcomer population.  BIONYX is the first randomised trial of the Resolute Onyx stent  and the first assessment of this stent in allcomers. Additionally,  this trial is the first randomised comparison of the Resolute  Onyx and Orsiro stents. Implications of all the available evidence The Resolute Onyx stent was non-inferior to Orsiro for the  combined safety and efficacy endpoint at 1-year follow-up in a  complex allcomer patient population. The preliminary  observation of a low incidence of stent thrombosis with  Resolute Onyx warrants further investigation.

After guide wire passage with or without  predilation, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to  Resolute Onyx or Orsiro stents. Web-based randomisation  was independently managed and done by members of  the catheterisation laboratory team, who used a custom- designed program that generated random block sizes  of eight and four, stratified by sex and diabetes. Patients  and assessors were masked to allocated stents (letters  and reports generally blinded to stent type), but treating  clinicians were not. Masking was maintained until the  independent external clinical event committee had  judged all adverse event triggers. Procedures The stent platform of the Resolute Onyx is made from a  single-strand, swaged shape composite wire that is  manufactured into a sinusoidal waveform and auto- matically welded at predefined connection sites. The  Resolute Onyx’s struts are thinner (81 μm uncoated strut  thickness in stents with diameters ≤4·00 mm) than its  predecessor’s (91 μm). The struts are circumferentially  covered with a 5·6 μm layer of the BioLinx durable  polymer that elutes zotarolimus (an antiproliferative  agent) for 6 months and consists of a blend of three  different polymers, which help to control drug release  and support biocompatibility. The increased radiopacity  together with a larger strut width-to-thickness ratio are  intended to improve visibility and deliverability while  maintaining longitudinal and radial strength. The Orsiro  stent has ultrathin cobalt–chromium struts with a  thickness of 60 µm (in stents ≤3·00 mm) or 80 µm (in  stents ≥3·50 mm), and has been previously described.23  The available stent diameters ranged from 2·00 mm to  5·00 mm for Resolute Onyx stents, and from 2·25 mm  to 4·00 mm for Orsiro stents. Coronary interventions were done according to  standard techniques. The use of lesion predilation and  stent postdilation was at the operator’s discretion.  Treatment within a single procedure was encouraged  if safe and reasonable. Planned staged procedures  were permitted within 6 weeks of the index procedure.  Operators were encouraged to use assigned stents if  additional lesions in the same patient required treat- ment. Concomitant drug therapy did not differ from  routine treatment. In general, dual antiplatelet therapy  was prescribed for at least 6 months in clinically stable  patients and for 12 months after acute coronary  syndromes. Choice of P2Y12 inhibitors besides aspirin  was based on international guidelines and local protocols.  In patients who required oral anticoagulation, aspirin  was generally discontinued after 1–6 months. Electrocardiographs were recommended at routine  clinical follow-up and systematically assessed. Laboratory  tests included systematic assessment of cardiac biomarkers  after the intervention and subsequent serial measurements  in case of suspected ischaemia. In patients with acute  coronary syndromes, cardiac biomarkers were generally  also assessed before intervention. Angiographic analyses  and offline quanti tative coronary angiographic measure- ments were done by analysts at an angiographic core  laboratory according to current standards (QAngio XA  version 7.3). At 1 year, clinical follow-up was done at patient visits  to outpatient clinics or, if not feasible, by telephone  follow-up or medical questionnaire (research staff  were masked). No routine angiographic follow-up was  done. The clinical research organisation the Foundation  for Cardiovascular Research and Education Enschede  (Enschede, Netherlands) coordinated trial and data  management. A formal data safety monitoring board  reviewed outcome data periodically. Data monitoring and processing of clinical outcome  data were done by an independent clinical research  organisation (Diagram, Zwolle, Netherlands). Monitoring  included informed consent and stent type (all patients);  potential clinical events reported by investigators, other  physicians, or patients; and further in-depth monitoring  of all demographic, procedural, and clinical outcome data  (in a random 10% of patients).

Outcomes Clinical endpoints were prespecified and defined  according to the Academic Research Consortium.24,25  The primary endpoint was target vessel failure at 1-year  follow-up—a composite of cardiac death, target-vessel- related myocardial infarction, or clinically indicated target  vessel revascularisation, representing device efficacy and  patient safety. Death was judged to be cardiac unless  an unequivocal non-cardiac cause could be established  (appendix). As in all previous TWENTE trials,9,10,12 myo- cardial infarction was defined as any creatine kinase  concentration of more than double the upper limit of  normal associated with increased confirmatory cardiac  biomarkers.25 Target-vessel-related myocardial infarction  was related to the target vessel or could not be related  to another vessel; further classification was based on  laboratory, electro cardio graphic, angiographic, and clin- ical data.23 Revascularisation procedures were judged to  be clinically indicated if angiographic percentage  diameter stenoses of the then-treated lesion were 50% or  greater in the presence of ischaemic signs or symptoms,  or if diameter stenoses were ≥70%.23,25 Secondary endpoints at 1-year follow-up included  individual components of the primary endpoint; all-cause  death; any myocardial infarction; clinically indicated  target lesion revascularisation; major bleeding; and stent  thrombosis. Additional composite endpoints were target  lesion failure (cardiac death, target-vessel-related myo- cardial infarction, or clinically indicated target lesion  revascularisation) major adverse cardiac events (all-cause  death, any myocardial infarction, emergent coronary  bypass surgery, or clinically indicated target lesion  revascularisation), and the patient-oriented composite  endpoint (all-cause death, any myocardial infarction, or  any coronary revascularisation). A prespecified subgroup  analysis of the primary endpoint was done in analogy  with previous trials.10,12 Statistical analysis The trial was designed to assess non-inferiority of the  primary endpoint at 1-year follow-up. Assuming a target  vessel failure rate of 6·0% on the basis of DUTCH  PEERS trial data,10 we estimated that 2470 patients would  provide 80% power to show non-inferiority with a margin  of 2·5%, an upper one-sided α of 0·05, and allowing for  at least 3·0% loss to follow-up. Sample size calculation  was done with PASS software (version 11.0.8). Analyses  were by intention to treat. A two-sided 90% CI (ie, a  5% one-sided significance level) was created for the  between-group difference in probabilities of the primary  endpoint. If non-inferiority were established, an add- itional superiority analysis would be done.

Time to endpoints was assessed by  the Kaplan-Meier method; the log-rank test was applied  for between-group com parisons. Hazard ratios (HRs)  were computed by Cox proportional hazards analysis. For  the primary endpoint, additional per-protocol and  sensitivity analyses (ie, adjusted for the stratification  factors sex and diabetes with a Cox model) were done. To  account for intra-patient correlation (because of inter- lesion dependence), additional lesion-based analyses  were done with the generalised estimating equations  method. Logistic regression was done to test for  interaction between subgroups and treatment with  regard to the primary endpoint. p values less than  0·05 were deemed to be significant. p values and CIs  were two-sided, except for the non-inferiority testing  (primary endpoint). Statistical analyses were done in  SPSS (version 22.0). This trial is registered with  ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02508714. Role of the funding source The study funders provided equal financial support, but  had no roles in study design; data collection, analysis, or  interpretation; or writing of the report. CvB, PZ, RAB,  CJMD, and MMK had full access to all study data, and  CvB, the corresponding author, had final responsibility  for the decision to submit for publication. Results Between Oct 7, 2015, and Dec 23, 2016, we randomly  assigned 2516 patients, after stratification for sex  and diabetes, to one of the trial stents (figure 1).  28 randomly assigned patients fulfilled an exclusion  criterion, so 2488 trial participants (3239 target lesions)  were included in the intention-to-treat analysis, 1243 in  the Resolute Onyx group (1646 lesions) and 1245 in the  Orsiro group (1593 lesions; figure 1). 2432 (97·7%) patients  completed 1-year follow-up and 46 (1·8%) died; thus  outcome data were available for 2478 (99·6%) patients.  Seven (0·3%) patients were lost to follow-up, and  three (0·1%) withdrew consent (figure 1). Participants were aged 30–96 years (mean 64·0  [SD 11·0]), 594 (23·9%) were women, 2370 (95·3%) were  white, 1765 (70·9%) presented with acute coronary  syndromes, and 1275 (51·2%) presented with acute  myocardial infarctions (table 1). Of all 3239 assessable  target lesions, 2255 (69·6%) were complex—ie, American  College of Cardiology and American Heart Association  lesion class B2 or C (table 2). A reference vessel size  (assessed by quantitative coronary angiography) less than  2·00 mm was present in 218 (8·8%), whereas a reference  vessel size greater than 4·00 mm was recorded in  71 (2·9%) patients. In 3194 (98·6%) of all 3239 lesions, at  least one randomly assigned stent was implanted, and  3184 (98·3%) lesions were treated with assigned stents  only. Of all 2125 implanted stents in the Resolute Onyx  group, 30 (1·4%) had a diameter of 2·00 mm and  13 (0·6%) had a diameter of 4·50 mm or greater.  Eight (0·4%) of 2055 implanted stents in the Orsiro group  measured 2·00 mm and four (0·2%) measured 4·50 mm  or greater (crossover). More than one vessel was treated  in 441 (17·7%) of all 2488 patients. Direct stenting was  done in 590 (23·7%) patients, and stents were postdilated  in 1721 (69·2%), without noticeable between-group  difference (table 1).

A per- protocol analysis to account for the possibility that  deviation from the assigned stent might have affected  the primary outcome had similar results (absolute risk  difference –0·03% [95% CI –1·7 to 1·6]; upper limit of  one-sided 95% CI 1·4%; pnon-inferiority=0·0012; appendix).  Additionally, results for the primary end point were  consistent in the sensitivity analysis (HR 0·9 [95% CI  0·7 to 1·4]; p=0·74) and across various subgroups  (figure 3). The frequencies of cardiac death, target- vessel-related myocardial in farction, and clinically  indicated target vessel revascu larisation (ie, the  individual com ponents of the primary endpoint) were  low and similar in both groups (figure 2B–D; table 3). At hospital discharge after the index procedure,  1214 (97·7%) of 1243 patients in the Resolute Onyx  group, and 1209 (97·1%) of 1245 in the Orsiro group  were treated with dual antiplatelet therapy (p=0·38). We  noted no between-group differences in P2Y12 inhibitors  or other drugs prescribed (appendix). At 1-year follow- up, 2067 (85·0%) patients were still on dual antiplatelet  therapy,  without  any  between-group  differences  (appendix).  Definite-or-probable  stent  thrombosis  occurred in one (0·1%) patient in the Resolute Onyx  group and nine (0·7%) in the Orsiro group (HR 0·11  [95% CI 0·01–0·87]; p=0·0112; figure 4). Definite stent  thrombosis occurred in one (0·1%) in the Resolute Onyx  group and seven (0·6%) in the Orsiro group (table 3).  One patient in the Resolute Onyx group developed a  subacute, non-fatal, definite stent thrombosis after self- discontinuation of aspirin and had an acute myocardial  infarction with cardiogenic shock that required urgent  revascularisation. Of the seven definite stent thromboses  in the Orsiro group, three were acute, two were subacute,  and two were late; all seven patients presented with  acute  myocardial  infarctions  while  taking  dual  antiplatelet therapy. Two patients in the Orsiro group  died suddenly 7 days after the index procedure, and  these events were classified as probable stent thrombosis.  None of the stent thromboses occurred in devices with  the smallest diameter available (ie, 2·00 mm; appendix). Discussion In this large-scale, international, randomly assigned  allcomers trial, we noted no difference between stent  groups in the incidence of the composite primary endpoint  of target vessel failure at 1 year. Thus, the Resolute Onyx  stent met the criterion of non-inferiority compared with  the Orsiro stent. The frequencies of the individual  components of the primary endpoint were similar and  quite low in both groups, which could be perceived as a  positive signal of safety for both devices. Although the  frequency of stent thrombosis was also low in both groups,  the risk was particularly low in the Resolute Onyx group,  which is noteworthy in view of the complexity of the trial  participants and coronary lesions treated. The only stent  thrombosis in a patient in the Resolute Onyx group  occurred subacutely in a vessel treated with four stents  along more than 10 cm, after the patient’s self-discon- tinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy. A previous study  showed that interruption of dual antiplatelet therapy  within 1 month of stent implantation was associated with  an increased risk of stent thrombosis,26 but none of the  seven patients in the Orsiro group who developed a  definite stent thrombosis was off dual antiplatelet therapy.  However, three of the seven patients had at least three  stents implanted with a total stent length of more than  9 cm. Additionally, preclinical studies showed that  thrombogenicity of the coating on the Orsiro stent is low.27  The use of dual antiplatelet therapy at discharge (97·4%) or  1-year follow-up (85·0%) did not differ between groups.  We noted no significant between-group difference in the  rate of any target lesion revascularisation (2·5% vs 2·0%),  and the small between-group difference in target lesion  revascularisation by coronary artery bypass surgery  (0·9% vs 0·2%; appendix) is probably chance. The BIONYX trial is the first randomised study of  Resolute Onyx, the first assessment of the stent’s safety  and efficacy in allcomers, and the first comparison of  the stent with Orsiro.

Table 3: Clinical events during 1-year follow-up Articles www.thelancet.com   Published online September 22, 2018   http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32001-4  7 41·3% of all patients who were percutaneously treated  (irrespective of inclusion or exclusion criteria; figure 1)  and included many patients with increased clinical,  lesion-related, or procedural risk. 1765 (70·9%) trial  participants were treated for acute coronary syndromes  and 1275 (51·2%) for acute myocardial infarction.  The clinical presentation of trial participants was  challenging and similar to that of participants in the  complex all comers population of the BIO-RESORT  trial,12 suggesting that the assessed study population  represents patients treated in routine clinical practice.  The age range of trial participants—30–96 years— reflects the non-discrim inating nature of our study.  Similar to previous trials10–12,20 in allcomers undergoing  percutaneous coronary intervention, almost a quarter  of all participants in BIONYX were women. More than  98% of all patients were exclusively treated with  randomly assigned stents, and outcome data were  available for 99·6% of patients. Despite the different durable and bioresorbable  polymer coatings and strut thicknesses of the two study  stents, we noted no advantages for one stent over the  other. The rates of the primary endpoint were low despite  the overall high complexity of patients and target lesions,  independent monitoring of all potential event triggers,  and almost complete follow-up. These event rates were  quite similar to the rates of the primary composite  endpoints reported in previous allcomers trials of  Resolute Integrity (ie, the predecessor of Resolute Onyx)  versus bioresorbable polymer-coated stents,11,12 or of the  Orsiro stent versus a durable polymer-coated stent.12,20 In  the SORT OUT VI trial11 of 2999 allcomers, the Resolute  Integrity stent was non-inferior to a bioresorbable  polymer-coated biolimus-eluting stent (BioMatrix Flex,  Biosensors Interventional Technologies, Singapore,  Singapore) in terms of the primary composite endpoint  of safety and efficacy at 1-year follow-up (5·3% vs 5·0%),  with no significant between-group differences in the  individual com ponents of the primary endpoint (ie,  cardiac death, target vessel-related myocardial infarction,  and target lesion re vas cularisation).

In BIOSCIENCE, the frequency of  definite stent thrombosis in the Orsiro group was 0∙9%,20  which is similar to that in the BIONYX trial (0∙6%). The  BIO-RESORT allcomers trial12 showed the non-inferiority  of the Orsiro stent (in 1169 patients) and a bioresorbable  polymer-coated everolimus-eluting platinum–chromium- based stent (Synergy, Boston Scientific, Natick, MA,  USA; in 1172 patients) to the Resolute Integrity stent (in  1173 patients) for the primary composite endpoint of  target vessel failure at 1 year (4∙7% and 4∙7% vs 5∙4%),  and no significant between-stent differences were noted  in any secondary clinical endpoint. In that trial, the  frequency of definite stent thrombosis at 1 year was  0∙3% in all stent groups.12 The incidence of definite-or-probable stent thrombosis  in the Orsiro group in our trial (0·7%) is similar to that  in several previous randomised allcomer trials of the  stent, such as BIO-RESORT (0·4%)12 and SORT OUT VII  (0·9%).21 In the Resolute Onyx group of our trial, the  incidence of definite-or-probable stent thrombosis was  very low (0·1%). In previous randomised allcomers  trials of Resolute Integrity, the frequency of definite- or-probable stent thrombosis was somewhat higher  (0·5% in BIO-RESORT,12 0·6% in DUTCH PEERS,10 and  0·8% in SORT OUT VI11). Additionally, in BIONYX, the  rate of definite stent thrombosis with Resolute Onyx  stents (0·1%) was below those with Resolute Integrity in  previous allcomers stent trials (0·3%–0·6%).10–12 The improved radiographic visibility of Resolute Onyx  could facilitate the recognition of stents that are not yet  well expanded or incompletely apposed to the arterial  wall. Theoretically, reduction of the occurrence of these  scenarios, which are both associated with stent throm- bosis,28 could have contributed to the particularly low  frequency of stent thrombosis in the Resolute Onyx  All patients  Men  Women  Acute coronary syndrome  Stable angina or silent ischaemia  Diabetes  No diabetes  Renal insuﬃciency  No renal insuﬃciency  Multivessel treatment  Single vessel treatment  Small vessel (<2·75 mm)  No small vessel  Bifurcation  No bifurcation  Lesion length >27 mm  Lesion length ≤27 mm  In-stent restenosis  No in-stent restenosis  Bypass graft  No bypass graft  Left main  No left main  Age ≥75 years  Age <75 years  Only stents ≤3 mm  Not only stents ≤3 mm  Previous percutaneous coronary intervention  No previous percutaneous coronary intervention    55/1243 (4·4)    38/946 (4·0)    17/297 (5·7)    40/880 (4·5)    15/363 (4·1)    18/260 (6·9)    37/983 (3·8)    7/83 (8·4)    48/1160 (4·1)    15/236 (6·4)    40/1007 (4·0)    31/675 (4·6)    24/568 (4·2)    25/485 (5·2)    30/758 (4·0)    15/245 (6·1)    40/998 (4·0)    6/44 (13·6)    49/1199 (4·1)    4/17 (23·5)    51/1226 (4·2)    4/25 (16·0)    51/1218 (4·2)    16/224 (7·1)    39/1019 (3·8)    32/685 (4·7)    23/557 (4·1)    18/262 (6·9)    37/981 (3·8)     58/1245 (4·7)    49/948 (5·2)    9/297 (3·0)    43/885 (4·9)    15/360 (4·2)    18/250 (7·2)    40/995 (4·0)    7/83 (8·4)    51/1162 (4·4)    19/205 (9·3)    39/1040 (3·8)    39/626 (6·2)    19/619 (3·1)    26/496 (5·2)    32/749 (4·3)    19/278 (6·8)    39/967 (4·0)    1/27 (3·7)    57/1218 (4·7)    2/23 (8·7)    56/1222 (4·6)    3/22 (13·6)    55/1223 (4·5)    16/251 (6·4)    42/994 (4·2)    34/674 (5·0)    23/570 (4·0)    16/278 (5·8)    42/967 (4·3)  0·95 (0·66–1·37)  0·77 (0·51–1·18)  1·90 (0·85–4·25)  0·93 (0·60–1·43)  1·00 (0·49–2·05)  0·95 (0·50–1·83)  0·93 (0·60–1·46)  0·98 (0·34–2·79)  0·94 (0·64–1·40)  0·68 (0·35–1·35)  1·06 (0·68–1·64)  0·73 (0·46–1·17)  1·38 (0·75–2·51)  0·98 (0·57–1·70)  0·92 (0·56–1·52)  0·90 (0·46–1·76)  0·99 (0·64–1·54)  3·79 (0·46–31·44)  0·87 (0·59–1·27)  2·69 (0·54–16·18)  0·90 (0·62–1·32)  1·20 (0·27–5·35)  0·93 (0·63–1·36)  1·11 (0·56–2·23)  0·90 (0·59–1·40)  0·92 (0·57–1·50)  1·02 (0·57–1·82)  1·20 (0·61–2·35)  0·87 (0·56–1·35)  0·0532  0·86  0·96  0·95  0·29  0·11  0·87  0·80  0·18  0·18  0·76  0·62  0·79  0·43  Resolute Onyx Orsiro 0·78  0·23  0·11  0·76  0·98  0·90  0·77  1·00  0·77  0·25  0·79  0·19  0·29  0·95  0·76  0·74  0·98  0·17  0·48  0·19  0·61  0·82  0·71  0·74  0·65  0·75  0·94  0·59  0·52  p value pinteraction Hazard ratio  (95% CI) Favours Resolute Onyx Favours Orsiro 0·1 1 10 Figure 3: Subgroup analyses for target vessel failure at 1 year in the Resolute Onyx and Orsiro stent groups Articles www.thelancet.com   Published online September 22, 2018   http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32001-4  9 group. However, the frequency of additional balloon  dilations (inside implanted stents) did not differ between  groups (69·1% vs 69·2%). This finding suggests that,  on average, there was no difference between groups  in operators’ effort to optimise procedural results.  Additionally, the quantitative coronary angiographic  analysis showed that lumen gain and final minimum  lumen diameter did not differ significantly between  groups. Nonetheless, the detection of only a few  (otherwise perhaps unnoticed) suboptimally deployed  Resolute Onyx stents could have contributed to the low  rate of stent thrombosis. Additionally, the use of the  swaged shape wire has lowered strut thickness by 10 μm  compared with the stent’s predecessor, and lowering  strut thickness reduces thrombogenicity.14 38 of the smallest stents (2·00 mm), which were  exclusively Resolute Onyx, were implanted (30 in the  Resolute Onyx group and eight in the Orsiro group  because of crossover). No stent thrombosis occurred in  these very small stents, which can be used to treat side  branches or the most distal coronary segments. However,  such lesions are generally treated with antianginal drugs  rather than invasive revascularisation. Nonetheless, after  stenting of large (main) vessels, the very small stents  could occasionally be helpful to keep open smaller side  branches that remain collapsed despite balloon dilatations  in the main vessel to open the struts. This technique  could help to avoid some (probably minor) periprocedural  myocardial infarctions. In our study, in both stent groups  the event rates for periprocedural myocardial infarction  (11 [0·9%] in the Resolute Onyx group vs 12 [1·0%] in the  Orsiro group) and any target vessel myocardial infarction  (18 [1·4%] vs 18 [1·4%]) were nearly identical. The very low rate of stent thrombosis in the Resolute  Onyx group supports the findings of a prospective registry29  of 101 patients with up to moderate risk, in whom  no definite-or-probable stent thromboses were recorded  within 12 months after implantation of 2·00 mm Resolute  Onyx stents. Furthermore, in a registry30 of 402 patients  with myocardial infarction who had Resolute Onyx stents  implanted, the frequency of definite-or-probable stent  thrombosis was 0·2%. Finally, in an angiographic endpoint  study,31 one (1%) of 75 patients implanted with Resolute  Onyx stents developed an acute definite stent thrombosis  during 8 months of follow-up. The  Promus  Element  durable  polymer-coated  everolimus-eluting platinum-chromium stent (Boston  Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) also has high radiographic  visibility.10,16 In the DUTCH PEERS trial,10 Promus  Element stents were postdilated significantly more  often than the less visible Resolute Integrity stents.  These findings appear to contrast with those of  BIONYX, in which the frequency of postdilation did  not differ noticeably between groups. However, factors  other than visibility could affect the frequency of stent  postdilation. Although Promus Element and Resolute  Onyx have high radiopacity in common, they differ in  many other characteristics (eg, strut materials, design  of platforms, the balloon catheters on which they are  mounted).16,17 These device features affect the spatial  stent geometry after deployment and, thus, the need for  stent optimisation. Additionally, the operators involved  play a part: some interventional cardiologists postdilate  stents irrespective of angiographic appearance after  deploy ment.10,12 Our study has some limitations. The incidence of the  primary endpoint was lower than assumed, but the  expected event rate was in line with outcomes in other  randomised allcomers stent trials.10,11 The lower-than- expected rates of the primary endpoint affect the  robustness of the results, particularly the results of  subgroup analyses. The non-inferiority margin (2·5%)  was lower than that in most other stent trials in  allcomers,10,12,13,20,22,32 but because of the low incidence of  the primary endpoint that margin represented more than  half of the recorded primary endpoint rate. Similar to  other randomised trials, we cannot exclude a certain  degree of under-reporting of events. Nonetheless, sub- stantial under-reporting seems unlikely, in view of  the systematic postprocedural assessment of cardiac  biomarkers and electrocardiograms, the high follow-up  rate, and the use of independent monitoring and event  adjudication. Additionally, several other stent trials also  had lower-than-expected event rates.10,12,32,33 We cannot  exclude the possibility that the event rates in our study  might be more representative of the outcome of present  coronary interventions, as opposed to when our trial was  designed, and that the choice of study centres with many  highly experienced operators could have favourably  Number at risk Resolute Onyx Orsiro 1243 1245 1237 1226 1236 1222 1232 1219 1226 1217 1223 1211 1218 1207 Time since initial procedure (days) 0 0·25 1·25 1·00 0·75 0·50 1·50 Incidence (%) 0 60 120 180 240 300 360 HR 0·11 (0·01–0·87), log-rank p=0·0112 0·7% 0·1% Resolute Onyx Orsiro † † † † † † * ‡ § § Figure 4: Cumulative incidence of definite or probable stent thrombosis at 1-year follow-up Definite or probable stent thrombosis with clinical consequences.

Additional factors could have lowered  event rates in our trial, such as the frequent use of more  potent P2Y12 inhibitors (55% vs 48% in BIO-RESORT12)  and the more frequent use of radial access (73% vs 45% in  BIO-RESORT12). Our study was not adequately powered  to reliably assess very rare clinical events, such as stent  thrombosis, and therefore stent thrombosis data should  be considered hypothesis generating. However, stent  thrombosis is such an important adverse event that our  findings should not be ignored—particularly because  Resolute Onyx is a novel stent that has never previously  been assessed in a randomised trial or in allcomers.  Centres that treat a low proportion of patients with acute  coronary syndromes might have different event rates,  because thrombus management and type, timing, and  duration of dual antiplatelet therapy could be the most  important factors in treatment of acute coronary  syndrome. 2-year follow-up will be of particular interest,  because most patients will stop dual antiplatelet therapy  after 1 year, which can be associated with an inherent  increase in the risk of stent thrombosis. Finally, we do  not have reliable data for the operators’ motivation for  using stents other than that assigned. We did not  formally restrict target vessel size but left decisions about  the treatability of lesions (with both stent types) to  the operators to reflect clinical practice, in which  implantation pressures can be adjusted to the vessel size  and stents can be overstretched by postdilations with  large balloons. Data for the use of dedicated techniques  for magnification and boosting of stents in radiographic  images were not collected. In conclusion, the novel Resolute Onyx stent was non- inferior to the reference Orsiro stent for a combined  safety and efficacy endpoint at 1-year follow-up in an  allcomers population with a high proportion of patients  with acute coronary syndromes. Other outcomes were  also favourable, and suggested that both stents are safe.  The very low frequency of stent thrombosis noted with  Resolute Onyx warrants further clinical investigation.

0%%%%%%Phase 2 Study Evaluating the Combination of Sorafenib and Temsirolimus in the Treatment of Radioactive Iodine-Refractory Thyroid Cancer Eric J. Sherman, MD 1,2; Lara A. Dunn, MD1,2; Alan L. Ho, MD, PhD1,2; Shrujal S. Baxi, MD 1,2; Ronald A. Ghossein, MD3; Matthew G. Fury, MD, PhD1; Sofia Haque, MD4; Cami S. Sima, MD5; Grace Cullen, BA1; James A. Fagin, MD1,2; and David G. Pfister, MD1,2 BACKGROUND: Patients with recurrent and/or metastatic, radioactive iodine-refractory thyroid carcinoma have limited treatment options. Sorafenib, an oral kinase inhibitor, is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of radioactive iodine-refractory thyroid carcinoma, although it demonstrated low response rates (12.2%) as a single agent in the first-line setting. The objective of the current study was to determine whether adding the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor temsirolimus to sorafenib could improve on these results. METHODS: In this single-institution, phase 2 study, 36 patients with metastatic, radioactive iodine-refractory thyroid carcinoma of follicular origin received treatment with the combination of oral sorafenib (200 mg twice daily) and intravenous temsirolimus (25 mg weekly). The receipt of prior systemic treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy and targeted therapy, including sorafenib, was permitted. The primary endpoint was the radiographic response rate. RESULTS: The best response was a partial response in 8 patients (22%), stable disease in 21 (58%), and progressive disease in 1 (3%). Six patients were not evalu- able for a response. Patients who had received any prior systemic treatment had a response rate of 10% compared with 38% of those who had not received prior systemic treatment. One of 2 patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer had an objective response. The progression-free survival rate at 1 year was 30.5%. The most common grade 3 and 4 toxicities associated with sorafenib and temsiroli- mus included hyperglycemia, fatigue, anemia, and oral mucositis. CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib and temsirolimus appear to be an active combination in patients with radioactive iodine-refractory thyroid carcinoma, especially in patients who received no prior treatment compared with historic data from single-agent sorafenib. Activity is also observed in patients who previously received sorafenib. This regimen warrants further investigation. Cancer 2017;000:000-000. V C 2017 American Cancer Society. KEYWORDS: anaplastic thyroid cancer, v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) mutation, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition, sorafenib, thyroid cancer. INTRODUCTION Treatment options for patients with recurrent and/or metastatic thyroid carcinoma who are not amenable to curative sur- gery or radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy are limited. Sorafenib is an oral kinase inhibitor (RTKI) that has multiple targets, including v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1), and VEGFR2.1 Sorafenib was approved in 2013 by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of radioactive iodine (RAI)-refractory thyroid cancer based on results from the DECISION trial. That phase 3 study dem- onstrated a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) over placebo.2 However, the improve- ment in PFS was only 5 months, and there was no significant improvement in overall survival between the study arms. Furthermore, the response rate was only 12.2%, and stable disease for at least 6 months was reported in only 41.8% of patients. Temsirolimus is an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Temsirolimus binds to an abundant intracellular protein (12-kDa FK506-binding protein [FKBP-12]) and, in this way forms a complex that inhibits mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling.3 The disruption of mTOR signaling suppresses the protein synthesis that regulates cell cycle progression4 and angiogenesis.5 In thyroid cells, mTORC1 activity is required for the proliferative effects of thyroid- stimulating hormone (TSH) in vitro and in vivo.6 Inhibition of mTORC1 also suppresses the growth of thyroid cancer Corresponding author: Eric J.

MATERIALS AND METHODS We completed a nonrandomized, phase 2 study at our institution, the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, evaluating the efficacy of combined sorafenib and temsir- olimus in patients with RAI-refractory thyroid cancer. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. Written, informed consent was obtained from all patients before study entry by 1 of the investigators. Patients Patients were eligible if they had histopathologically con- firmed thyroid cancer of follicular cell origin, which included papillary, follicular, Hurthle cell, or anaplastic histologies. Patients were required to have available pathology for BRAF mutational testing. The inclusion cri- teria were as follows: 1) surgically inoperable and/or recur- rent/metastatic disease, 2) at least 1 measureable lesion according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) version 1.0, 3) at least 1 lesion that was fluorodeoxyglucose-avid on a positron emission tomogra- phy scan with a maximum standard uptake value >3, 4) progressive disease, and 5) disease refractory to RAI uptake. RAI-refractory disease was defined as either 1) absent or insufficient RAI uptake in all lesions or in an index lesion, 2) disease progression after RAI treatment, or 3) fluorodeoxyglucose-avid lesions.8 Major eligibility crite- ria also included an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group functional status from 0 to 2 and normal metabolic func- tion and hematopoiesis. Furthermore, participants were excluded for any recent, significant cardiovascular disease or thromboembolic events, untreated brain metastases, nonhealing wound, history of gastrointestinal perforation, or any predisposition to gastrointestinal perforation. Prior treatment with sorafenib (or other treatment) was permit- ted, but patients who had received prior treatment with mTOR inhibitors were excluded. Study Treatment On the basis of phase 1 results, participants received oral sorafenib 200 mg twice daily and intravenous temsiroli- mus 25 mg weekly.9 A cycle was considered 4 weeks of treatment. After 6 cycles of treatment, participants and their physicians were given the option to decrease the fre- quency of temsirolimus to 3 weekly treatments during every 4-week cycle. Restaging studies were done every 2 cycles for the first year and then every 3 cycles after the first year. Serum thyroglobulin levels were measured every 2 cycles (except in patients who had a positive antibody to thyroglobulin). Statistical Analysis The primary objective was to determine the objective response rate to sorafenib and temsirolimus. Secondary objectives were to determine PFS and whether there was an association between response and BRAF mutation sta- tus. The safety and tolerability of this combination was an additional secondary endpoint. An exact 1-stage, phase 2 design was used to assess the primary endpoint of the radiographic response rate (partial or complete responses according to RECIST 1.0 criteria) to combined sorafenib and temsirolimus, with a 15% response rate considered not promising and a 34% response rate considered promising. The probabilities of a Type I error (falsely accepting a nonpromising therapy) and Type II error (falsely rejecting a promising therapy) were set to 0.1 and 0.1, respectively. We planned to evalu- ate a total of 36 patients. If �9 of the 36 patients evaluated had a partial response (PR), then the regimen would be considered worthy of further investigation. PFS was defined from the start of treatment until either disease progression or removal from the study. A post hoc analysis was done correlating changes in the thy- roglobulin serum level between baseline and at about 8 weeks with the duration of time on treatment to deter- mine whether this had any predictive value. Testing for BRAF valine-to-glutamic acid substitu- tion at codon 600 (V600E) mutations was done either by Sequenom (LabCorp, Burlington, NC) or polymerase chain reaction sequencing.10 In 17 patients, testing for a RAS mutation was also done. In 4 patients, tumors also were tested using a next-generation sequencing clini- cal assay (MSK-IMPACT11), which tests for 341 key can- cer genes, including those along the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/mTOR/protein kinase B(AKT) pathway. RESULTS Patient and Tumor Characteristics In total, 37 patients were eligible and enrolled on this study. One patient signed consent and was registered but subsequently died of disease progression before receiving treatment on study and was not included in the analysis. Original Article 2 Cancer Month 00, 2017 According to the protocol, this patient was replaced. Patient and tumor characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Mutational testing for BRAF V600E mutation was per- formed on tumors of all enrolled patients, and 10 (28%) were positive (Table 1). Testing for mutations along the PI3K/mTOR/AKT pathway only occurred in 4 patients, and only 1 had any mutation along this pathway. The majority of patients on study had received prior systemic treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy for thyroid cancer (Table 1). Of the 20 patients (56%) who received prior treatment, 9 received cytotoxic chemotherapy, 18 received targeted therapy, and 8 received both cytotoxic chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Six patients (17%) received prior sorafenib, and 16 (44%) received prior VEGF-targeted therapy. Fifteen of the 18 patients (some received more than a single line of treatment) who received prior targeted therapy did so on a clinical trial evaluating the following agents: VEGF trap (n 5 11), XL281 (a Raf kinase inhibitor; n 5 3), AZD6244 (a mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor; n 5 2), depsipeptide (n 5 1), PTC229 (eukaryotic trans- lation initiation factor 1A extracted from strain PTC229) with docetaxel (n 5 1), and pazopanib (with paclitaxel; n 5 1). Ten patients received 2 or more lines of prior treatment. Response Rate Response rates are summarized in Tables 2–4 and in Figure 1. The best response for all patients was deter- mined for 30 patients. Six patients were not evaluable because they came off treatment before the first radio- graphic scan for reasons other than progression of disease, which included excessive toxicity (n 5 1), withdrawal of consent (n 5 3), and seeing other treatment (n 5 1). Eight patients (22%) had a PR, and no patients had a complete response. The median time to a PR according to RECIST criteria for the 8 patients was 5.1 months (range, 1.4-8.7 months). One patient had a PR that was not con- firmed with repeat imaging before removal from the study for toxicity and thus was categorized as having stable dis- ease as the best response. The majority of patients, specifi- cally, 21 (58%), demonstrated stable disease. Only 1 patient had disease progression as the best response. Patients who had not received prior systemic treat- ment were more likely to have a PR from combined sora- fenib and temsirolimus compared who those who did receive prior systemic treatment (38% vs 10%). BRAF mutational status did not significantly correlate with response to treatment. Five of the 6 patients who received prior sorafenib were evaluated for best response. One patient had a PR, and 4 had stable disease; the patient with a PR developed progressive disease after <3 months on sorafenib. Accord- ing to RECIST 1.0 criteria, the maximum disease shrink- age in this patient was 251%, and he was on study for 22.5 months before the disease began to progress. Analysis of his tumor revealed a phosphatase and tensin homolog (pTEN) mutation. Histologic subtype was not associated with response to therapy (for a breakdown, see Table 4).

Sorafenib/Temsirolimus Thyroid Cancer/Sherman et al Cancer Month 00, 2017 3 Time on Treatment, PFS, and Overall Survival The median duration of treatment was 6.7 months (range, 0.5-63 months) (Table 3). In total, 11 patients (30.5%) remained on the study for >1 year, and 5 (13.8%) remained on the study for >2 years. Six patients discon- tinued sorafenib before their removal from the study and continued on temsirolimus alone for a range of 1.1 to 38 months. Based on best response, the median treatment dura- tion was 22.3 months (range, 6.7-63 months) for patients who had a PR and 7.4 months (range, 1.3-19.5 months) for those with stable disease. The 1 patient who had pro- gressive disease as his best response was on study for 0.5 months. In addition, the median treatment duration was 3.3 months (range, 0.5-22.5 months) for patients who had received prior systemic treatment, 7.5 months (range, 1.1-22.5 months) for those who had received prior sorafe- nib, and 8.7 months (range, 0.7-63 months) for those who had not received prior systemic treatment. Patients with BRAF V600E mutation were on study for a median of 5.2 months (range, 0.7-63 months), whereas those without BRAF V600E mutation were on study for a median of 6.7 months (range, 0.5-25.6 months). In 17 patients, tumors were tested for the pres- ence of a RAS mutation. Six of these 17 patients (35%) had a RAS mutation. There was no significant difference in the time on treatment between the 2 groups, with a median time of 7.7 months in the RAS mutant cohort and 6.7 months in the RAS-negative cohort. When we limited the analysis only to those patients who came off the study for disease progression (n 5 18), the median time on treatment was 15.2 months (range, 0.5-63 months). In this group, 6 of the 18 patients had a BRAF mutation, and the median time on treatment was 19.3 months versus 12.5 months for the BRAF wild-type group (P 5 .17; log-rank test). One of 2 study patients who had anaplastic thyroid cancer and attained a PR to combination therapy was on study for 6.9 months. The tumor in this patient was nega- tive for a BRAF mutation. The PFS rate at 1 year was 30.5%. The median over- all survival for all patients on the study was 24.6 months. The median overall survival for patients who had a PR, stable disease, and disease progression as their best response was 33.7, 24.0, and 1.2 months, respectively. Change in Thyroglobulin Levels Change in the serum thyroglobulin level from baseline was measured in 26 patients (excluding any who had posi- tive thyroglobulin antibodies during the study or who did not have a second thyroglobulin test at 8 weeks on treat- ment). Comparing the baseline value with that obtained at 8 weeks, the median thyroglobulin change was an increase of 2% (ranging from a decrease of 84% to an increase of 183%). Twelve patients had a decrease in their first thyroglobulin level while receiving treatment com- pared with baseline. If the thyroglobulin level decreased by �10% (11 patients) at approximately 8 weeks on treat- ment, then there was no significant increase for the time TABLE 2.

Of those 11 patients with decreased thyro- globulin levels, 2 (18%) had a PR and 9 (82%) had stable disease. Of the other 15 patients without this decrease, 4 (27%) had a PR. Toxicity and Study Removal Five patients (14%) came off the study because of toxicity parameters specified in the protocol. Six patients discon- tinued sorafenib because of toxicity without removal from study and were continued on single-agent temsirolimus. Of the 12 patients who withdrew consent, only 1 patient withdrew from the study because of side effects. However, 2 patients withdrew consent after discontinuing temsiroli- mus because of thrombocytopenia and chose not to remain on study with single-agent sorafenib. An addi- tional 3 patients withdrew consent for symptomatic dete- rioration or functional decline, and 1 patient withdrew consent to receive palliative radiation therapy, which required an interruption of study treatment. Five patients withdrew consent for failure to achieve a response to treat- ment despite not meeting criteria for disease progression. In addition, 3 patients came off the study for clinical dis- ease progression, and 2 were removed from the study at their physicians’ discretion because of transaminitis and a nonhealing ulcer related to study treatment. Two patients died while on study: One died in her sleep while on the study from an unknown cause but had experienced an increasing failure to thrive that had started before she began treatment. She was on study for 2.1 months at the time of her death without reported toxicities. The other patient died from likely progressive, metastatic osseous disease, which caused vertebral compression deformities. This death occurred after the patient was on study for 25.9 months. Reasons for removal from the study are summarized in Table 5. The toxicities experienced by the 5 patients in the study who withdrew because of predefined study parame- ters included bowel perforation (n 5 2), excessive fatigue (n 5 2), and pneumonitis (n 5 1). The median time on study for these 5 patients was 1.7 months (range, 0.7-3.0 months). In the patient who was removed from the study because of grade 4 bowel perforation, tumor was observed at the site of perforation at the time of surgical resection; therefore, this event was more likely because of disease rather than excessive toxicity. The other patient who was removed for bowel perforation had grade 2 toxicity that did not require surgical management. TABLE 4.

Sorafenib/Temsirolimus Thyroid Cancer/Sherman et al Cancer Month 00, 2017 5 The most common grade 3 and 4 toxicities related to sorafenib and temsirolimus included hyperglycemia (n 5 7), fatigue (n 5 5), anemia (n 5 4), and oral mucositis (n 5 3). One of the 2 sudden deaths on study was catego- rized as possibly related to drug toxicity. Because there was no clear cause of death for the patient who died in her sleep and no autopsy was performed, it was reported as a possibly associated toxicity. A list of grade 3, 4, and 5 toxicities that were at least possibly related to treatment is provided in Table 6. Twenty-two of 36 patients (61%) required a dose reduction in at least 1 of the drugs during the course of treat- ment. In addition, 23 patients (64%) experienced at least 1 grade �3 toxicity during the course of treatment. DISCUSSION Compared with historic data from single-agent sorafenib, the addition of an mTOR inhibitor to sorafenib appears to provide additional activity in patients with metastatic, RAI-refractory thyroid cancer. In first-line treatment on 2 separate phase 2 clinical trials and the registration phase 3 clinical trial, single-agent sorafenib produced response rates of 11% to 23%.2,12,13 Specifically, in the random- ized phase 3 DECISION trial, the response rate was 12.2% in the sorafenib group compared with 0.5% in the placebo group (P < .0001).2 In our current study, the combination of sorafenib and temsirolimus produced a PR rate of 22%, and stable disease was the best response in more than one-half (58%) of all patients. Unlike the DECISION trial, this study included patients who had received prior systemic therapy, including sorafenib. In the subgroup of patients who received this combination in the first-line setting in the current study, PRs occurred in 38% of patients, and 56% had stable disease. This trial also demonstrated a response to combina- tion therapy in 2 patients who had previously received sys- temic chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy, including 1 patient who had progressed on sorafenib. What is not known is whether the benefit in this group was because of the addition of temsirolimus to sorafenib or temsirolimus alone. A single-agent mTORC1 inhibitor, however, reportedly produced a response rate of only 5% but had a PFS of 43 weeks.14 However, the patient in our trial who had previously received sorafenib, who had a confirmed response, and who had the longest PFS did have a pTEN mutation. The current results did not indicate that response to sorafenib and temsirolimus was correlated with BRAF mutational status. Because BRAF mutational status did not affect response, the benefit of sorafenib may be related to a target other that RAF. Similar findings have been reported elsewhere in thyroid cancer.15 However, when we evaluated only those patients who were removed from the study for actual disease progression, there was a non- significant increase in the time on treatment of 6.8 months in those who had BRAF V600E mutations com- pared with those who had wild-type BRAF. Therefore, the presence of a BRAF mutation still may have some effect on treatment duration and should be explored further. It should be noted that 1 of our 2 patients with ana- plastic thyroid cancer had a durable objective response. This patient met criteria for a PR according to RECIST criteria after 1.6 months on combination treatment at the time of the first restaging scan and remained on study for 6.9 months. This patient did not harbor a BRAF V600E mutation. The patient was aged 81 years, which typically would be considered a poor risk factor,16 and had previ- ously received treatment with paclitaxel, pazopanib, and TABLE 5.

Original Article 6 Cancer Month 00, 2017 radiation therapy on Radiation Therapy Oncology Group trial RTOG0912 (with progression of disease at the time of initiating the study). Adverse events consisted of the known side effects for both agents. Overall, the side-effect profile of this combination was tolerable; and, other than hyperglyce- mia, the other grade 4 toxicities and deaths on study were not definitely related to adverse effects associated with the treatment. The percentage of patients requiring dose reductions (61%) or withdrawal (14%) because of adverse events was similar to previously reported percen- tages among patients who received sorafenib alone (66% and 19%, respectively),2 suggesting a similar toxicity profile. This study started before publication of results from the DECISION study and before US Food and Drug Administration approval of sorafenib for RAI-refractory thyroid cancer. Since this study’s inception, there have been other studies in this disease, including a randomized phase 3 study comparing lenvatinib versus placebo in both the first-line and second-line setting (SELECT), which reported a response rate of 64.8% in the lenvatinib- treated group.17 Other VEGF RTKIs that have been eval- uated in the phase 2 setting include pazopanib (PR rate, 49%),18 vandetanib (PR rate, 1%),19 sunitinib (PR, rate 28%),20 axitinib (PR, rate 31%),21 and motesanib (PR, rate 14%).22 With the exception of the SELECT study, none of the other studies treated patients who had received prior VEGF-directed treatment. Although it is not appropriate to compare the activ- ity of agents across separate studies, the PR rate of 38% observed in patients who did not receive prior VEGF- directed therapy with sorafenib and temsirolimus is favor- able compared with the rates reported for most of the other VEGF RTKIs studied. In terms of the response rate and PFS, lenvatinib has the most favorable data to date of all of these VEGF RTKIs in both phase 223 and phase 317 studies. However, the published results for lenvatinib indicate no significant difference in PFS whether lenvati- nib is used in the first line (median PFS, 18.7 months) or the second line (median PFS, 15.1 months). Because, to date, no other VEGF RTKI has produced similar activity in the second-line setting after the receipt of first-line len- vatinib, it is very reasonable to study treatment in the first-line setting that might not be as active as lenvatinib in patients with RAI-refractory thyroid cancer when the clinician can reasonable expect that the patient will be able to receive more than 1 line of therapy and will be able to receive lenvatinib in the second line. CONCLUSION Although the current study did not meet its a priori target of responses in 9 of the 36 patients who received com- bined sorafenib and temsirolimus, the statistics were set up before better data became available about the activity of sorafenib in thyroid cancer and in the absence of avail- able data on previously treated patients. The sorafenib and temsirolimus combination appears to be active in patients with RAI-refractory thyroid cancer, producing impressive response rates in patients who received no prior treatment compared with historic data from single-agent sorafenib. Responses, along with durable disease stabiliza- tion, also were observed among patients who had received prior VEGF-targeted therapy, including sorafenib. The combination of sorafenib and temsirolimus in patients with RAI-refractory thyroid cancer is worthy of further investigation, particularly in comparisons with single- agent sorafenib. Finally, 1 of the 2 patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer in our study experienced a major response to sorafenib and temsirolimus, and this specific patient requires further assessment in future studies.

Pecker, MD Abstract Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a monogenic disorder that afﬂicts approximately 100,000 Americans and millions of people worldwide. It is characterized by hemolytic anemia, vaso-occlusive crises, relentless end-organ injury, and premature death. Currently, red blood cell transfusion and hydroxyurea are the major disease-modifying therapies available for SCD. Hematopoetic stem cell transplant is curative, but barriers to treatment are substantial and include a lack of suitable donors, immunologic transplant rejection, long-term adverse effects, prognostic uncertainty, and poor end-organ function, which is especially problematic for older patients. Gene therapy to correct the bs point mutation is under inves- tigation as another curative modality. Deeper insights into the pathophysiology of SCD have led to the development of novel agents that target cellular adhesion, inﬂammation, oxidant injury, platelets and/or coagulation, vascular tone, and hemoglobin polymerization. These agents are in preclinical and clinical trials. One such agent, L-glutamine, decreases red blood cell oxidant injury and is recently US Food and Drug Administration approved to prevent acute pain episodes of SCD in patients 5 years of age or older. The purpose of this review is to describe the currently established therapies, barriers to curative therapies, and novel therapeutic agents that can target sickle cell hemoglobin polymerization and/or its downstream sequelae. A PubMed search was conducted for articles published up to May 15, 2018, using the search terms sickle cell disease, novel treatments, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and gene therapy. Studies cited include case series, retrospective studies, prospective clinical trials, meta-analyses, online abstracts, and original reviews. ª 2018 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research n Mayo Clin Proc. 2018;nn(n):1-15 F or this review, we conducted a PubMed search for articles published up to May 15, 2018, using the search terms sickle cell disease, novel treatments, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and gene therapy. Studies cited include case series, retrospective studies, prospective clinical trials, meta-analyses, online abstracts, and original reviews. Sickle cell disease (SCD), described as the “ﬁrst molecular disease” in 1949,1 comprises congenital hemolytic anemias caused by the inheritance of point mutations in the b-globin allele. Sickle cell disease is an umbrella term that includes homozygous sickle cell anemia (SCA), which is deﬁned by the exclusive pro- duction of hemoglobin [Hb] S (HbSS and HbSb0), and compound heterozygous SCD, deﬁned by the production of HbS and another abnormal b-globin protein (HbS/bþ thalas- semia, HbSC, or HbS inherited with other Hb variants like HbD, HbE, Hb Lepore, Hb O Arab), also called sickle cell variant disease. Life expectancy is shortest for people with HbSS and HbSb0 who are at greater risk for central nervous system complications, ne- phropathy, and early death than people with compound heterozygous SCD.2,3 Across geno- types, clinical phenotype is improved by the presence of high HbF levels and/or coinheri- tance of the a-thalassemia trait.4,5 PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms contribute to the clinical manifestations of SCD. Under conditions of low oxygen tension, HbS polymerizes in red blood cells (RBCs) and forms elongated rods that alter RBC rheology. Hemoglobin S polymerization is initially reversible, but repeated deoxygenation/reoxy- genation cycles cause RBC surface property changes, membrane damage, and hemolysis. Altered RBC conformation leads to vaso- occlusion, ischemia, and inﬂammation.6-9 Hemoglobin Secontaining reticulocytes are From the Division of He- matology/ Oncology, Department of Medicine, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, OH (S.K., J.A.L.); Division of Hema- tology/Oncology, Case Western Reserve Univer- sity, Cleveland, OH (S.K., J.A.L.); and Division of Pe- diatric Hematology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD (L.H.P.).

Ongoing drug development efforts target these mechanisms. EPIDEMIOLOGY AND CLINICAL COMPLICATIONS In the United States, 90,000 to 100,000 people have SCD,23 and survival into adulthood is nearly universal.24 Improved survival is a conse- quence of 6 decades of progress in the ﬁeld. Common diagnostic, prevention, and treatment strategies responsible for these advances include newborn screening, penicillin prophylaxis,25 vaccinations against encapsulated organisms, transcranial Doppler (TCD) screening (to iden- tify and then treat children at risk of stroke with transfusions),26,27 and aggressive, inten- sive hospital-based care. For patients with HbSS and HbSb0, early initiation of hydroxy- urea has also contributed to decreased symptom burden and is associated with increased longevity.28 In resource-rich countries, the burden of morbidity and mortality from chronic end-organ damage has shifted into adulthood. Globally, nearly two-thirds of infants with HbSS are born in Nigeria, the Republic of Congo, or India, where childhood mortality remains high.29 By 2050, the increased use of newborn screening and penicillin prophy- laxis and vaccination in developing countries may prevent up to 5 million deaths in children with SCD.29 In 2010, the number of newborns with homozygous SCD worldwide was 305,800. By 2050, it will be approximately 400,000.29 This expanding and aging popula- tion of people with SCD is likely to place major demands on global health care resources if they experience the protean clin- ical manifestations of SCD. Sickle cell disease complications are acute and chronic. Acute complications include pain crises, acute chest syndrome, stroke, and hepatic or splenic sequestration. Common sites of chronic injury are the brain, eyes, heart, kidneys, lungs, and liver. These compli- cations require intensive outpatient, inpatient, and emergency department care. Unfortu- nately, despite considerable need, few curative therapies or disease-modifying agents that target the underlying pathobiology in SCD exist. Hydroxyurea and long-term treatment with blood transfusions are the only disease modifying therapies that prevent and treat acute and chronic complications in SCD. Allo- geneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is the only cure, and gene therapy is under investigation as a potential curative strategy. Further advances in our understand- ing of the underlying pathophysiology of SCD contribute to the development of exciting and novel targeted therapies to prevent and treat SCD complications. Drugs that inhibit cellular adhesion, reduce oxidative injury, membrane ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS d Historically, long-term treatment with red blood cell trans- fusions and hydroxyurea have been the only disease-modifying therapies to treat sickle cell disease. L-glutamine, a precursor of the antioxidant nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Adminitration to prevent acute pain episodes of sickle cell disease (SCD) in patients 5 years of age or older; many other drugs are under investigation. d Two curative therapies for SCD are being studied: hemato- poietic stem cell transplant and gene therapy. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant cures some patients with SCD, and obsta- cles to widespread use include the lack of suitable donors, concern for immunologic transplant rejection, and long-term adverse effects (especially for older patients). Gene therapy to correct the bs mutation is under investigation. Both of these strategies require further study. d Sickle cell disease’s complex pathophysiology includes patho- logic interactions of sickled red blood cells, reticulocytes, neu- trophils, platelets, adhesion molecules, and the vascular endothelium. This forms the basis for novel agents, currently under development, targeting cellular adhesion, inﬂammation, oxidative injury, vascular tone, and hemoglobin polymerization.

In this review, we discuss established and developing treatments for SCD (Table) and clas- sify them on the basis of their mechanism of action (Figure 2). Therapies that decrease HbS polymerization are discussed ﬁrst, followed by those that target the downstream effects of HbS polymerization. REDUCTION OF HBS POLYMER FORMATION AND CORRECTING THE MOLECULAR DEFECT Hydroxyurea Hydroxyurea was the ﬁrst US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)eapproved drug for the treatment of homozygous SCD and is the only disease-modifying therapy that is supported by robust evidence inchildren and adults. Hydroxy- urea is a ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase inhibitor ﬁrst used as cytoreductive therapy for myeloproliferative diseases. Hydroxyurea increases fetal Hb (HbF; a2g2) production and decreases intracellular HbS polymerization, an effect that is sustained with long-term use but is reversible on drug discontinuation.31 The dis- covery that hydroxyurea increases HbF levels led to initial trials of the drug in patients with HbSS.32,33 Secondary cellular beneﬁts from hydroxyurea for patients with homozygous SCD include decreasing leukocyte, platelet, and reticulocyte counts and changes in cellular, in- ﬂammatory, and adhesion molecule expression that reduce pathologic cellular adhesion and inﬂammation.34-36 Studies in adults and children supporting the use of hydroxyurea in homozygous SCD led to the FDA’s approval of hydroxyurea for adults nearly 20 years ago and for children in 2017. The 1995 Multicenter Study of Hydroxyurea (MSH) was a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of hydroxyurea in adults with HbSS. In the MSH, those treated with hydroxyurea had fewer painful crises and acute chest syndromes (2.5 vs 4.5 crises per year and 25 vs 51, respectively; P<.001), FIGURE 1. Pathophysiology of vaso-occlusion in sickle cell disease. Hemolysis of sickle red blood cells (RBCs) releases heme that depletes nitric oxide (NO) and causes monocyte activation, thereby triggering endothelial activation. Increased activity of endothelial E-selectin and P-selectin results in leukocyte adhesion. In addition, increased erythrocyte intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) 4 expression binds endothelial aVb3 integrin, and leukocyte-expressed activated aMb2 integrin (MAC-1) traps hemoglobin Se containing RBCs, leading to adhesion and consequent vaso-occlusion. Antiadhesive therapies (yellow) may decrease adhesion as shown.

The Pediatric Hydroxyurea Phase III Clin- ical Trial (BABY HUG) was a phase 3 multicenter placebo-controlled trial of hydroxyurea for in- fants (9-18 months) with HbSS. BABY HUG did not meet its primary end points: there was no difference in splenic or renal function in chil- dren treated with placebo vs hydroxyurea.28 TABLE.

In the United States, this recommenda- tion appears to be associated with increased hydroxyurea prescribing.48 Despite increased treatment acceptance, major barriers to implementing hydroxyurea treatment for all eligible patients remain. Prominent barriers include (1) adverse effects such as rash, alopecia, nail discoloration, headache, nausea, and weight gain, unresolved concerns for decreased fertility (especially in males), and teratogenicity49-51; (2) deciding the optimal timing of treatment initiation in children; in Europe, concerns about unknown and understudied effects of hydroxyurea, including infertility and carcinogenesis, limit hydroxyurea prescribing to children with severe disease34,51-53; (3) prescriber discom- fort and delay in initiating therapy for eligible patients54; (4) poor patient adherence to a life- long regimen34; and (5) lack of high-quality evidence for use in patients with variant SCD (compound heterozygotes) who comprise one-third of all patients with SCD.55 Of note, worries about carcinogenesis from hydroxyurea arose in patients treated for myeloproliferative neoplasms,52 which have a baseline increased risk of hematologic malig- nancy. The association of carcinogenesis with hydroxyurea is not substantiated by the avail- able literature. One study found a 2-fold increased age-related risk of leukemia in patients with SCD in California compared with the general population, irrespective of treatment.56 This ﬁnding may reﬂect the natu- ral history of SCD in the emerging population of older adults with SCD. Long-term follow- up of patients initiating hydroxyurea in child- hood may help clarify whether concerns about hydroxyurea’s carcinogenic potential are war- ranted.31,57 Ultimately, hydroxyurea is not a panacea for people with HbSS. Damage to the kidney,58 brain,59 and spleen60 is not entirely prevented with treatment. Novel Antisickling Agents Hemoglobin S polymerization is the ﬁrst step in the cascading pathophysiology of SCD. Hemo- globin S polymerization is inhibited by agents that (1) induce HbF (eg, hydroxyurea [discussed previously], decitabine, pomalidomide, panobi- nostat, INCB059872, and sodium butyrate), (2) disfavor polymerization by preventing dehydra- tion (senicapoc and magnesium), (3) delay pro- duction of deoxyhemoglobin S by shifting the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve to the left (increasing afﬁnity of Hb for oxygen, eg, Aes- 103 and GBT440), (4) deliver carbon monoxide to the RBC (pegylated carboxyhemoglobin),61 and (5) inhibit sickling via an unknown mecha- nism (SCD-101 and Nicosan).

Framework for categorization of current treatments for sickle cell disease. This pyramid depicts a classiﬁcation of treatment modalities into primary treatments (that target the hemoglobin S (HbS) mutation and/or polymerization) and secondary treatments (that target one of the down- stream consequences of HbS polymerization). The primary treatments are predicted to have more widespread effect because they treat the root cause and prevent all downstream consequences of sickling. HbF ¼ he- moglobin F; HSCT ¼ hematopoietic stem cell transplant; IVIG ¼ intrave- nous immunoglobulin; Omega-3 FA ¼ omega-3 fatty acid. NOVEL TREATMENTS FOR SICKLE CELL DISEASE Mayo Clin Proc. n XXX 2018;nn(n):1-15 n https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2018.08.001 www.mayoclinicproceedings.org 5 has a dose-dependent antisickling effect. In a phase 1b dose-escalation study in patients with SCA, SCD-101 was tolerated well and decreased chronic pain and fatigue.62 Part B of this phase 1b clinical trial is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of SCD-101 in patients with SCA and is currently recruiting (NCT02380079). Another antisickling agent with an unknown mechanism of action, Nicosan (or Niprisan) is a plant extract shown to decrease painful crises in Nigerian patients.63,64 There are no trials studying Niprisan in the United States. Clinical trials investigating the use of the afore- mentioned agents are enrolling patients (Table). Long-term Transfusion Therapy Long-term therapy with RBC transfusion is an alternative to hydroxyurea. Strong evidence guides the use of long-term RBC transfusions for children with HbSS and abnormal to prevent stroke.26,27 The multicentered Stroke Prevention Trials in Sickle Cell Anemia (STOP I and II) trials reported that long- term transfusion therapy in children with abnormal TCD reduced stroke risk and that this salutary effect was lost when transfusions were stopped. 26,27 The Stroke With Transfu- sions Changing to Hydroxyurea (TWITCH) trial found that transitioning from long-term transfusion therapy to hydroxyurea, at the maximum tolerated dose in children with abnormal TCD but no severe vasculopathy, was noninferior to long-term transfusions in children and could be used as an alternative to transfusions for primary prevention of cere- brovascular disease.65 Long-term transfusion therapy is performed as simple transfusions or partial or complete ex- change transfusions (erythrocytapheresis). Risks of long-term transfusion therapy include transfu- sional iron overload (less so with exchange trans- fusions), which accumulates over time and can be life-threatening, alloimmunization, and trans- mission of transfusion-associated infections.66-71 Delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions second- ary to alloimmunization complicate 4% to 11% of transfusions for SCD.67,72 Stem Cell Replacement/Modiﬁcation Therapies Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant. AllogeneicHSCTcuresSCDbyeliminating sickle Hb production by replacing existing hematopoeticstem cellswith cellsfrom an alloge- neic donor. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant is used when the beneﬁts of cure outweigh the risks of transplant-associated toxicities and when a suitable donor is available. Beneﬁts of HSCT include the physiologic normal erythropoiesis, prevention of end-organ damage, and decreased SCD-associated morbidity and mortality.73 Concerns about HSCT include patient selection (based on age, disease severity, and end-organ injury), risk of short-term toxicity (infection, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, death), graft failure, possibility of long-term adverse effects (graft-vs-host disease [GVHD], infertility), selection of an effective and mini- mally toxic preparative regimen (myeloablative vs nonmyeloablative), and a limited donor pool.73-75 Deﬁning eligibility for HSCT is challenging and isbased on individualized analysis of beneﬁts and risks. Age is a strong determinant of success- ful HSCT. In pediatric patients, matched sibling donor transplants with myeloablative regimens have been successful.76,77 Among 1000 HLA- identical sibling HSCT recipients from a world- wide cohort, age was a signiﬁcant risk factor for mortality. The overall survival of patients older than 16 years was 80% compared with 95% 5-year overall survival in those younger than 16 years (P<.001).78 Tools to predict SCD severity to determine transplant eligibility are limited and predominantly include major SCD compli- cations.79 In 2014, an international expert panel recommended that HSCT with unrelated or hap- loidentical grafts in a controlled trial setting be considered for patientswith severecomplications of SCD, including stroke, recurrent vaso- occlusive crisis (>2 episodes per year), recurrent priapism, impaired neuropsychological function, stage I or II sickle cell lung disease,80 acute chest syndrome, sickle nephropathy, bilateral prolifer- ative retinopathy, osteonecrosis, or transfusion- related alloimmunization.81 The panel also rec- ommended that symptomatic patients be offered transplant from available HLA-identical sibling stem cells or HLA-identical sibling cord blood as early as preschool age.81 The availability of a suitable donor is a pre- requisite to HSCT for transplant-eligible patients and a major barrier to treatment. Only 10% to 20% of patients with SCD in the United States have a matched sibling, matched unrelated donor, or preserved cord MAYO CLINIC PROCEEDINGS 6 Mayo Clin Proc. n XXX 2018;nn(n):1-15 n https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2018.08.001 www.mayoclinicproceedings.org bloods available.74 Thus, recent approaches to HSCT focus on expanding the donor pool by using matched unrelated donors and haploi- dentical donors.82-84 In children, matched un- related donor recipients have lower 1- and 2- year event-free survival of 76% and 69%, respectively, and lower corresponding overall survival of 86% and 79%.82,85 In a pilot multi- center study (STRIDE [Study of Hematopoiet- ic Stem Cell Therapy for Young Adults with Severe Sickle Cell Disease]), related and unre- lated donor HSCT with a reduced toxicity conditioning regimen in 22 adults with severe SCD, 1-year event-free and overall survival were higher at 95%, without any graft failure and very low rates of GVHD (2 patients with acute grade 1 skin GVHD and 3 with chronic GVHD).86 At present, cord blood donors are too risky for use in SCD (SCURT [Sickle Cell Unrelated Donor Transplant Trial] study).87,88 Haploidentical HSCT is experimental in chil- dren and adultsdBMT CTN 1507 (NCT03263559) and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute intramural 17-H-0069 (NCT03077542) are 2 trials investigating non- myeloablative preparative regimens with bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell grafts, respectively.89 Haploidentical HSCT is associ- ated with higher transplant morbidity and graft failure, but this approach continues to be pursued because of the potential to consid- erably expand the donor pool.78,83 Children undergoing matched sibling trans- plants tolerate myeloablative regimens well.76,77 In adults, myeloablative regimen toxicity may be prohibitive and needs further study. Although reduced-intensitynonmyeloablativeHSCTswere initially associated with only transient donor engraftment,84 long-term engraftment with a stable mixed- and full-donor chimerism has improved in subsequent studies (2014 National Institutes of Health study and STRIDE, respec- tively).86,90 Both myeloblative (NCT02675959, NCT01590628, and NCT02179359) and non- myeloablative (NCT01499888, NCT01850108, and NCT03249831) strategies to restore either normal or partial erythropoiesis, respectively, are under investigation at a number of sites.90 Major concerns about HSCT remain. Whether HSCT prolongs life for patients with SCD is unclear.91 In a Belgian cohort, survival in adults and children treated with hydroxyurea was superior to those treated with HSCT.91 Optimization of nonmyeloablative strategies and strategies to expand the donor pool may in- crease the availability of HSCT; routine reas- sessments of a patient’s baseline SCD and the risks of HSCT are thereby necessary.79 Infer- tility is a risk for all patients undergoing HSCT.92 Fertility preservation, even for very young children, should be offered before treat- ment. Finally, recommendations for asymp- tomatic patients and those with compound heterozygosity have not been made.73 Gene Therapy. Gene therapy is the “Holy Grail” of SCD treatment and has long been sought as a deﬁnitive cure. In 2017, Ribeil et al93 reported that a 13-year-old boy with HbSS disease had been cured with gene ther- apy. This thrilling event marked the ﬁrst time an antisickling b-globin variant (bA-T87Q) had been successfully transferred into a human pa- tient. Recent technological breakthroughs, such as in situ gene mutagenesis (eg, via CRISPR/ Cas9), are creating opportunities for genetic manipulation (gene insertion, deletion, or modiﬁcation) by deleting the HbS mutation or increasing HbF production through silencing a repressor of HbF production (eg, BCL11A).94,95 After encouraging mouse studies of gene ther- apy,96,97 2 clinical trials studying gene therapy using a lentiviral vector in adults with ho- mozygous or severe variant SCD are under way (NCT02247843, NCT02186418). More studies are needed to establish this therapy’s durability and safety. A myeloablative condi- tioning regimen followed by the infusion of manipulated autologous stem cells is under investigation.98 A major advantage of gene therapy over HSCT is the ability to use autologous stem cells, thus obviating the need to identify donors. However, like HSCT, undergoing gene therapy requires exposure to radiation and chemo- therapy. Lentiviral transfer has not been associ- ated with insertional carcinogenesis or mutagenesis to date,99,100 but long-term studies are needed to adequately assess this risk. TARGETING DOWNSTREAM CONSE- QUENCES OF HBS POLYMERIZATION Antioxidant Therapy L-glutamine. L-glutamine is an amino acid precursor for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NOVEL TREATMENTS FOR SICKLE CELL DISEASE Mayo Clin Proc. n XXX 2018;nn(n):1-15 n https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2018.08.001 www.mayoclinicproceedings.org 7 (NAD) and is required for the formation of the antioxidant reduced NAD (Figure 3). Nicotin- amide adenine dinucleotide production is adequate in patients with SCD, but erythrocyte glutathione and glutamine levelsare signiﬁcantly depleted.101,102 This decrease has been attrib- uted to the increased oxidant burden in sickle RBCs and higher L-glutamine consumption.103 Decreased L-glutamine levels lead to lower NAD redox potential and impair erythrocyte integrity, increase hemolysis, and deplete NO. Glutamine depletion is a biomarker for hemo- lysis and is independently associated with pulmonary hypertension in patients with SCA.101 The effect of L-glutamine in SCD has been studied, but to validate its beneﬁts and feasi- bility in age- and genotype-speciﬁc popula- tions, additional peer-reviewed evidence is needed. In a prospective interventional study of 7 adults with SCA, L-glutamine powder sup- plementation for 4 weeks resulted in increased RBC reducing potential and subjective improvement in energy levels.104 In 2005, a cross-sectional and prospective study of 9 adults with SCA found that L-glutamine sup- plementation led to diminished adhesion of treated RBCs to human umbilical vein endothe- lial cells.104,105 In 2014, a 2:1 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase 3 study of L-glutamine oral powder in 230 patients (5- 58 years of age) with HbSS and HbS b0 thalas- semia was conducted.106 Results of this trial have not yet been published in a peer- reviewed journal. Data available on the FDA website show that patients receiving L-gluta- mine had fewer painful events over the 48- week study period (3 events vs 4 events; P¼.008), lower incidence of hospitalization (2 events vs 3 events; P¼.005), a decreased dura- tion of hospital stay (6.5 days vs 11 days; P¼.022), decreased development of acute chest syndrome (11.9% vs 26.9%; P¼.006), and a lengthened median time from randomization to ﬁrst crisis (87 days vs 54 days; P¼.01). Treat- ment effect was independent of hydroxyurea use.107 These data formed the basis for FDA approval in patients with SCD aged 5 years and older. Although L-glutamine is approved for all SCD types, the phase 3 study included only patients with HbSS. Genotype-speciﬁc subgroup analyses are not yet available, nor are estimates of cost or feasibility. N-acetylcysteine. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant used as a mucolytic for respi- ratory diseases that decreases dense cell and irreversibly sickled cell formation in patients with homozygous SCD.108 N-acetylcysteine is converted to L-cysteine in the cytoplasm, which increases glutathione levels. In a phase 2 study of 21 patients with SCA who were older than 15 years, NAC restored gluta- thione levels, decreased dense cell formation, and led to a statistically insigniﬁcant decrease in the number of painful crises.109 A pilot study is currently enrolling partici- pants with HbSS to evaluate the effects of intravenous NAC on plasma von Willebrand factor parameters, redox, and RBC function (NCT01800526). a-Lipoic Acid and L-acetylcarnitine. A com- bination of potent antioxidants, a-lipoic acid and acetyl-L-carnitine, was given to 14 patients with hemoglobinopathies (11 with SCD and 3 with HbH-Constant Spring) and signiﬁcantly improved the redox state of glutathione (reduced:oxidized glutathionine) at 3 weeks.110 A phase 2 study in patients with SCA assessed reduction in oxidant stress and pain crises using these agents (NCT01054768); results are not available yet. Other Antioxidant Agents. Gum arabic, omega-3 fatty acids, and curcumin are reported to diminish oxidative stress in SCD but have not achieved widespread clinical applicability to date.111-113 Inhibition of Cellular Adhesion Numerous novel antiadhesive agents that target RBC-endothelial and leukocyte-endothelial in- teractions are in development. P-selectin Inhibitors. P-selectin mediates leukocyte and erythrocyte adhesion to the vascular endothelium and contributes to vaso- occlusion in patients wth SCD.30,114 P-selectin is stored in endothelial cell granules and is released to the cell surface when stimulated by histamine, thrombin, endotoxin, peroxides, or hypoxia.6,114 In a transgenic mouse model expressing human HbS, blocking or depleting P-selectin decreased erythrocyte and leukocyte adhesion.115,116 Crizanlizumab (SEG101) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to MAYO CLINIC PROCEEDINGS 8 Mayo Clin Proc. n XXX 2018;nn(n):1-15 n https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2018.08.001 www.mayoclinicproceedings.org P-selectin and blocks P-selectin’s interaction with P-selectin glycoprotein 1 on circulating leukocytes. The Phase II, Multicenter, Ran- domized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind, 12-Month Study to Assess Safety and Efﬁcacy of SelG1 With or Without Hydroxyurea Therapy in Sickle Cell Disease Patients With Sickle Cell- Related Pain Crises (SUSTAIN) trial found that high-dose crizanlizumab (5 mg/kg) resulted in a 45.3% decreased rate of crises per year (P¼.01) and increased the time to the ﬁrst crisis (4.07 vs 1.38 months; P¼.001) or second crisis (10.32 vs 5.09 months; P¼.02) compared with pla- cebo.117 There were no differences in hemolytic parameters between the interventional and placebo arms, suggesting that treatment beneﬁt may be attributable only to modiﬁed cellular adhesion. The reduction in annual crisis rate was greater in patients not taking hydroxyurea compared with those who were (50% lower vs 32.1% lower, respectively). The SUSTAIN trial included patients aged 16 to 65 years and all SCD genotypes, but 70% of study patients had HbSS. Additional studies are therefore needed to address use in pediatric patients and to assess efﬁcacy by genotype. Adverse events were comparable between treatment and placebo groups. Pan-selectin Inhibitors. Rivipansel (GMI- 1070), a synthetic pan-selectin inhibitor that inhibits cell-cell interactions and adhesion, prolonged survival in Berkeley sickle cell mice118 and was associated with signiﬁcant decline in intravenous opioid use (83% lower opioid use compared with placebo) when tested in 73 adults with SCA.119 A phase 3 trial of rivipansel safety and efﬁcacy is recruiting patients (NCT02187003). Other Antiadhesive Therapies Intravenous Immunoglobulin. In a sickle cell mouse model, intravenous immunoglobulin inhibited RBC-neutrophil and neutrophil- endothelial adhesive interactions and improved microcirculatory blood ﬂow and survival.120,121 A phase 2 study is currently recruiting patients to evaluate the safety and efﬁcacy of intravenous immunoglobulin in pa- tients with SCD within 24 hours of admission with a pain crisis (HbSS and HbS b-thalassemia, NCT01757418). FIGURE 3. Normal glutathione metabolism. Glutathione is an antioxidant that reduces reduced nico- tinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAD[P]H) in the red cell. Glutathione is synthesized from the amino acids glutamate, glycine, and, cysteine by the g-glutamylcysteine synthetase and glutathione syn- thetase. In patients with sickle cell disease, glutathione and glutamine levels are low despite increased availability of glutamate, cysteine, and glycine, resulting in increased oxidant stress. L-glutamine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2017 to replenish the erythrocyte reducing po- tential.

NOVEL TREATMENTS FOR SICKLE CELL DISEASE Mayo Clin Proc. n XXX 2018;nn(n):1-15 n https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2018.08.001 www.mayoclinicproceedings.org 9 Heparin. Heparins are anti-inﬂammatory and inhibit P-selectinemediated adhesion.122 A randomized, double-blind trial found that tin- zaparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin, reduced the duration of vaso-occlusive crisis without any severe bleeding complications.123 A feasibility trial is currently recruiting participants to assess the effect of unfractionated heparin in acute chest syndrome (NCT02098993). Propranolol. In a phase 1 dose-escalation study, propranolol decreased sickle RBC adhesion in a dose-dependent manner when human RBCs from propranolol-treated pa- tients with homozygous SCD were infused into nude mice.124 Maximum inhibition was achieved at a dose of 40 mg. No signiﬁcant heart rate changes or severe adverse events were reported.124 Results from a double-blind crossover phase 2 study (NCT01077921) revealed decreased levels of measured soluble biomarkers including E-selectin, P-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 in patients with ho- mozygous SCD treated with propranolol compared with placebo, but these decreases were not statistically signiﬁcant.125 This study was not published in a peer-reviewed journal. Because of the high prevalence of asthma in children with SCD, a phase 1 study of pro- pranolol in children without asthma was initiated but eventually terminated due to inability to recruit patients (NCT02012777). No studies of propranolol in humans with HbSS are currently open. Antiplatelet Therapy Activated platelets are common in SCD and may contribute to vaso-occlusion by participating in intercellular adhesion and forming multicellular aggregates.126 Prasugrel is a third-generation thienopyridine that inhibits adenosine diphosphateemediated platelet activation and aggregation by irreversibly binding to the P2Y12 class of adenosine diphosphate recep- tors. The Determining Effects of Platelet Inhibi- tion on Vaso-Occlusive Events (DOVE) trial was a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of prasugrel in children and adolescents aged 2 to 17 years with HbSS that did not ﬁnd a reduced rate of vaso-occlusive crises with prasugrel treatment.127 In a phase 1 study in patients with SCA, another antiplatelet agent, eptiﬁbatide, a platelet glycoprotein aIIbb3 antagonist, inhibited platelet aggregation and favorably altered inﬂammatory mediators.128 A phase 2 placebo-controlled trial reported the safety of eptiﬁbatide in 13 patients with SCD with acute pain crises but did not ﬁnd improve- ment in recovery times or time to hospital discharge.129 A secondary analysis revealed that eptiﬁbatide inhibited platelet aggregation, platelet release, and platelet P-selectin expres- sion and decreased platelet-leukocyte aggre- gates and inﬂammatory markers.130 That antiplatelet agent monotherapy does not beneﬁt patients with SCD suggests that other mecha- nisms involved in vaso-occlusion may be more prominent drivers of SCD pathophysiology. However, more research with well-powered studies is needed to deﬁnitively determine the efﬁcacy of antiplatelet agents for treating or pre- venting pain. Agents Affecting Vascular Tone Intravenous magnesium, inhaled NO, and sildenaﬁl, agents that improve vascular tone and endothelial dysfunction, have not reduced the frequency or duration of painful crises in patients with homozygous and variant SCD.131-133 CHALLENGES AND PITFALLS A lack of equitable National Institutes of Health funding134 and small clinical trials contribute to the limited clinical armamentarium against SCD. Nevertheless, the development of novel treatments for SCD is an area of active research. Current evidence for many therapies is limited by the need for age- and genotype-speciﬁc research. The management of SCD is limited by many unanswered clinical questions and challenges, such as (1) treatment options for pa- tients with SCD who are pregnant,135 (2) the ethical dilemmas posed by the current state of HSCT136,137 and gene therapy, especially for asymptomatic patients and (3) optimum pain management in a population faced with lifelong episodes of acute and chronic pain that evolves with age and is exacerbated by socioeconomic stressors and age.138,139 Ironically, painda substantial and bedeviling problem for patients, their families, and their physicians alikedis, with few exceptions,140 seldom speciﬁcally targeted in therapeutic trials. MAYO CLINIC PROCEEDINGS 10 Mayo Clin Proc. n XXX 2018;nn(n):1-15 n https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2018.08.001 www.mayoclinicproceedings.org CONCLUSION Disease-modifying therapies for SCD include hydroxyurea, now FDA approved for adults and children with homozygous SCD, and long-term transfusions. Nearly 2 decades after the approval of hydroxyurea, L-glutamine was FDA approved with little published peer- reviewed evidence and many remaining ques- tions about its use and tolerability. Antisickling gene therapy is an exciting and promising area of research but is not yet established as safe or efﬁcacious. Allogeneic HSCT is the only cura- tive treatment and has recently shown promise in older adults as well. Early referral for evalua- tion for HSCT is strongly encouraged for patients with symptomatic SCD. There is an unmet need for disease- modifying therapies in SCD, and a great deal of recent scientiﬁc discovery has led to the development and testing of novel agents that are in preclinical and clinical testing. In the coming decades, these new approaches, once optimized, may considerably brighten the outlook for patients with SCD, their families, and their physicians.

Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% conﬁdence intervals were estimated by Cox proportional-hazard regression models, adjusting for age, sex, baseline folate, vitamin B12, blood pressure, body mass index, smoking and alcohol drinking status, study center, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting glucose, creatinine, and treatment group. Potential effect modiﬁcation by the MTHFR genotype on the relationship between tHcy and all-cause mortality was tested. Results: The analyses included 20,424 hypertensive patients (41% males) without a history of myocardial infarction or stroke. Baseline mean age (SD) was 60±7.5 years and mean (SD) serum tHcy was 14.5±8.4mmol/L. After a mean follow-up period of 4.5 years, there were 612 (3%) all-cause deaths. Kaplan–Meier survival curves revealed a graded relationship between tHcy quartiles and all-cause mortality. The HRs, using the lowest quartile as the reference, were 1.2, 1.2, and 1.5 in Q2, Q3, and Q4, respectively. A linear trend test, using natural log-transformed tHcy, resulted in an HR of 1.5 (95% conﬁdence interval 1.2–1.9, P<.001) after adjustment for lifestyle and health-related variables. Whereas the MTHFR genotype alone had little effect on mortality, it signiﬁcantly modiﬁed the tHcy–mortality association, which was much stronger in the CC/CT genotype than in the TT genotype (P for interaction<0.05). Conclusions: Among Chinese hypertensive patients without cardiovascular comorbidities, elevated tHcy was a signiﬁcant risk marker for death from all causes, and the association was subject to effect modiﬁcation by MTHFR genotypes. If conﬁrmed that tHcy and MTHFR genotypes may serve as useful biomarkers for mortality risk assessment and targeted intervention.

Introduction Elevated levels of blood homocysteine (Hcy) is a well-recognized and modiﬁable risk factor for cardiovascular disease.[1] As early as 1969, McCully[2] linked severe hyperhomocysteinemia with atherosclerosis and vascular thrombosis. Subsequent research has demonstratedanassociationbetweenmildlytomoderatelyelevated Hcy,andcoronary,cerebral,andperipheralvasculardiseases.[1,3–5] Compared with cardiovascular events, all-cause mortality, despite its public health importance, has been less well-studied in homocysteine research. In the past 20 years, research, mostly in western populations, has indicated a link between elevated Hcy and increased mortality.[6–8] For example, plasma total homo- cysteine (tHcy) levels conferred a graded and independent risk of all-cause mortality among 587 patients (median age 62 years) with coronary artery disease in Norway.[6] Elevated plasma tHcy (14.26 or higher mmol/L) increased all-cause mortality by 50% among 1933 older (mean age 70 years) Framingham men and women.[9] Elevated plasma tHcy (14 or higher mmol/L) increased total mortality in a community based study in Israel.[10] However, there are still important knowledge gaps in this ﬁeld. First of all, there is lack of data on whether elevated tHcy is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in hypertensive patients. Previous studies have shown that tHcy and hypertension can synergistically increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke.[11] Patients with “H-type hypertension,” a term to describe hypertensive patients with elevated homocysteine, are a subgroup at a particularly high risk of stroke.[12] In a subgroup analysis (n=166) of an earlier study, elevated tHcy was associated with all-cause mortality in the hypertensive partic- ipants, but not in the normotensive participants.[8] Clearly, more study is needed to examine this possibility. Notably, previous studies found that the relationship between tHcy and mortality varied by the participant’s pre-existing medical conditions. For example, in a Netherlands study, the Hcy–mortality association was signiﬁcantly greater in type 2 diabetic patients than in nondiabetic patients (odds ratio [OR] 2.5 vs 1.3).[13] No association was found between tHcy and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease in a US population.[14] As such, to answer the aforementioned question, an ideal study design would be to assess tHcy–mortality association in hypertensive patients without other cardiovascular comorbidities. Such a study is yet to be conducted. Secondly, methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is a critical enzyme involved in the Hcy metabolic cycle.[15] Mutation from the wild type of MTHFR at position 677 from C to T impacts the activity of the MTHFR enzyme. The TT mutation causes the encoding of a thermolabile enzyme to reduce its activity by 70%. Whereas studies have examined the impact of the MTHFR genotype on tHcy levels,[8,16] few studies have examined the effect modiﬁcation of MTHFR gene polymorphism on Hcy–mortality association, in part, due to a lack of large-scale cohort studies with data on individual tHcy, MTHFR genotype, and mortality. Finally, few tHcy–mortality studies have been conducted in Asian populations including Chinese populations. There are over 300 million hypertensive patients in China alone. Compared with western populations, Chinese populations have a much higher prevalence of elevated tHcy. In particular, about 75% of hypertensive patients have elevated tHcy.[17] In addition, the MTHFR 677TT gene variant is present in about 25% of the Chinese population, again, much higher than that of western populations. These characteristics have made China a compelling setting to examine the independent and joint effect of tHcy and MTHFR C677T polymorphism on all-cause mortality. Findings from such a study have important clinical and public health implications, for example, identiﬁcation of high-risk individuals and development of more effective personalized prevention. Using data from the China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial (CSPPT, N=20,424),[17] this study aimed to examine the longitudinal association between tHcy and 5-year all-cause mortality in Chinese adults with hypertension, but without history of stroke or myocardial infarction (MI). It further tested the hypothesis that the association between tHcy and all-cause mortality can be modiﬁed by the MTHFR C677T polymorphism. 2. Methods 2.1. Study participants and design This study included 20,424 participants of the CSPPT (clin- icaltrials.gov identiﬁer: NCT00794885) with complete data on baseline tHcy and MTHFR genotype. All participants had Xu et al. Medicine (2017) 96:8 Medicine 2 hypertension, but with no pre-existing cardiovascular or cerebral vascular conditions. The CSPPT was approved by the ethics committee of the Institute of Biomedicine, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China (FWA assurance number FWA00001263). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Details regarding the study design, study protocol, and ﬁeld data collection of the CSPPT have been published previous- ly.[17] Brieﬂy, the CSPPT was a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial conducted from May 2008 to August 2013 in 32 communities in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, China. It aimed to evaluate whether a combined therapy of enalapril plus folic acid (FA) is more effective than enalapril alone in reducing the risk of stroke in hypertensive patients. The CSPPT enrolled men and women aged 45 to 75 years who had hypertension, deﬁned as seated resting systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥140mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥90mm Hg at both the screening and the recruitment visit, or who were on antihyper- tensive medications. The major exclusion criteria included history of physician-diagnosed stroke, MI, heart failure, postcoronary revascularization, or congenital heart disease. Eligible participants, stratiﬁed by MTHFR C677T genotypes (CC, CT, or TT), were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups: a daily oral dose of 1 tablet containing 10mg enalapril and 0.8mg FA; or a daily oral dose of 1 tablet containing 10mg enalapril only. During the trial period, concomitant use of other antihypertensive drugs (mainly calcium channel blockers or diuretics) was allowed, but B-vitamin supplementation was not. Participants were scheduled for follow-up every 3 months until completion of the trial. Each visit included measuring and recording of blood pressure (BP), pulse, treatment compliance, concomitant use of other medications, adverse events, and study outcome events. 2.2. Blood pressure measurements These details have been previously published.[18] Brieﬂy, SBP/ DBP (mm Hg) was measured at baseline and at each follow-up visit with the participant in a seated position after having rested for more than 5minutes, and using a mercury sphygmomanom- eter with an appropriate cuff size. At each visit, 3 consecutive measurements were obtained on the right arm, with 1-minute intervals between each, and the mean value was calculated. The mean SBP and DBP over the treatment periods were also calculated. 2.3. All-cause mortality All-cause mortality, a prespeciﬁed endpoint of the CSPPT, was the main outcome in this analysis and deﬁned in previous publications.[17,19] All-cause mortality includes death due to any reason. Evidence for death included death certiﬁcates from hospitals or reports after a home visit by a trained investigator. All-cause deaths were reviewed and adjudicated by an indepen- dent Endpoint Adjudication Committee, whose members were unaware of treatment-group assignments. 2.4. Laboratory tests As described in previous publications, overnight fasting venous blood samples were collected at baseline.[17,20] Laboratory tests were performed at the core laboratory of the National Clinical Research Center for Kidney Disease (Nanfang Hospital, Guangzhou, China). Fasting plasma glucose, fasting lipids (serum total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], and triglycerides), serum tHcy, and creatinine were measured using automatic clinical analyzers (Beckman Coul- ter). Serum folate and vitamin B12 were measured at baseline by a commercial laboratory using a chemiluminescent immunoassay (New Industrial). MTHFR C677T (rs1801133) polymorphisms were detected on an ABI PRISM 7900HT sequence detection system (Life Technologies, CA) using the TaqMan assay. 2.5. Covariates Covariates included age, sex, body mass index (BMI) (weight kg/ height m2), baseline SBP and DBP, mean SBP and DBP during treatment period, baseline serum total cholesterol, HDL-C, triglycerides, fasting glucose, creatinine, folate, vitamin B12, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and treatment group. 2.6. Statistical analysis Means (standard deviation [SD]) or proportions were calculated for population characteristics by tHcy quartiles, the major exposure variable. All-cause mortality over the course of the follow-up period was the main outcome of interest. Cumulative hazards of all-cause mortality by tHcy quartiles were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method, and group differences were compared by log-rank tests. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs) were estimated by Cox proportional- hazard regression models, adjusting for important covariables, including age (<55, 55 to <65, and ≥65), sex, baseline folate quartiles, vitamin B12 quartiles, SBP at baseline (<160, ≥160mm Hg), BMI (<25, ≥25kg/m2), smoking and alcohol drinking status, study center, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-C, fasting glucose, creatinine, and treatment group. Potential effect modiﬁcation by the MTHFR genotype on the relationship between tHcy and all-cause mortality was evaluated by stratiﬁed analyses and by interaction testing. A 2-tailed P<0.05 was considered to be statistically signiﬁcant in all analyses. R software, version 3.2.0 (http://www.R-project.org/) and Empow- er (R) (www.empowerstats.com, X&Y Solutions, Inc. Boston, MA) were used for all statistical analyses. 3. Results 3.1. Study participants and baseline characteristics The CSPPT had a total of 20,702 participants. After excluding 278 participants without baseline tHcy, this study included 20,424 participants for the ﬁnal analysis. Table 1 presents demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of the study participants by baseline tHcy quartiles. The average age was 60.0 years and 41% were male. All participants were hypertensive patients, with a mean baseline SBP of 167 and DBP of 94mm Hg. None of the participants had a prior history of MI or stroke. Over the course of treatment, mean SBP was 139 and mean DBP was 83mm Hg. The frequency of the MTHFR C677T polymorphism was 27% for CC, 49% for CT, and 24% for TT, a genotype distribution that is consistent with the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. The mean (±SD) baseline tHcy levels were 14.5± 8.6mmol/L in the enalapril group and 14.4±8.1mmol/L in the enalapril+FA group. Higher levels of tHcy were associated with older age, male sex, elevated serum creatinine levels, lower folate levels, and the MTHFR TT genotype. Xu et al.

Association between tHcy and all-cause mortality Among the 20,424 participants, there were 612 (3%) all-cause deaths during a mean treatment period of 4.5 years. Figure 1A presents the Kaplan–Meier curves for cumulative hazards of all- cause mortality, stratiﬁed by quartiles of tHcy. A dose–response relationship is evident between baseline tHcy and all-cause mortality; participants in the fourth quartile of tHcy had the highest risk, whereas those in the ﬁrst quartile had the lowest risk. This relationship was further evaluated using the Cox Table 1 Characteristics of study population in total sample and stratiﬁed by total homocysteine quartiles.

The HRs, using the lowest quartile as the reference, were 1.2, 1.2, and 1.5 in Q2, Q3, and Q4, respectively; however, signiﬁcance was only attained in the fourth quartile (P<0.01). A linear trend test using natural log-transformed tHcy resulted in an HR of 1.5 (95% CI 1.2–1.9), with a P<0.001. The HRs were very similar after adjusting for the MTHFR genotype. 3.3. Association between the MTHFR genotype and all- cause mortality Figure 1B presents the Kaplan–Meier curves for cumulative hazards of all-cause mortality, stratiﬁed by MTHFR genotypes. Participants with the TT genotype had a slightly higher risk of death compared with the CC or CT genotypes, but the log-rank test was not signiﬁcant. Consistently, there was no signiﬁcant association between the MTHFR genotype, and mortality as evaluated by the Cox proportional-hazards model, adjusting for age, sex, study center, baseline SBP and DBP, mean SBP and DBP, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-C, fasting glucose, folate, B12, creatinine, BMI, smoking, alcohol use, and treatment group (Table 2). The HRs were very similar after adjusting for tHcy. 3.4. Interaction of the MTHFR genotype and tHcy on mortality We investigated the potential modifying effect of the MTHFR genotype on the association between tHcy and mortality. Subjects with the CC and CT genotypes were grouped together and compared with TT genotypes. As shown in Fig. 2, although a dose–response trend is evident for both the CC/CT and TT groups, the linear slope was greater for the CC/CT group compared with the TT group. This differential association was further conﬁrmed by Cox proportional-hazards modeling, adjusting for pertinent covariables (Table 3). A linear trend test using natural log-transformed Hcy resulted in an HR of 1.8 (95% CI 1.3–2.5, P<0.001) for the CC/CT group, and 1.3 (95% CI 0.9–1.9, P=0.23) for the TT group. The test for interaction between LnHcy and genotype (CC/CT vs TT) on all-cause mortality was signiﬁcant (P=0.04). 3.5. Other effect modiﬁers on the tHcy–mortality relationship We examined other potential effect modiﬁers on the association between tHcy and mortality (Supplemental Table 1, http://links. lww.com/MD/B549). Whereas the general direction of the association was consistent across the strata of age, sex, baseline SBP, BMI, glucose, cholesterol, creatinine levels, and treatment group, the strength of the tHcy–mortality association varied across the strata. However, testforinteraction was only signiﬁcant forage (P<0.001) and baseline creatinine (P<0.01) strata. 4. Discussion To our knowledge, this was the ﬁrst and largest study to examine the longitudinal association between tHcy and a 5-year all-cause mortality in a Chinese hypertensive population, and to test the hypothesis that the tHcy0mortality association can be modiﬁed by the MTHFR C677T genotype.

Medicine (2017) 96:8 www.md-journal.com 5 This study, using data from the CSPPT, comprised the following unique features. First, the CSPPT included Chinese hypertensive participants without pre-existing stroke and/or MI. With a low vascular disease burden and a low frequency use of cardiac and vascular protective drugs, our results were less likely to be confounded by medications and vascular diseases. Second, the CSPPT participants had a much higher prevalence of elevated homocysteine (∼75%) and the MTHFR 677TT genotype (∼24%) than western populations, offering an exceptional opportunity to examine genetic modiﬁcation with sufﬁcient statistical power. Third, the CSPPT obtained data on individual MTHFR genotype for all participants and measured tHcy levels for 98.7% of participants. In contrast, many previous studies lacked individual MTHFR genotype data and/ or only measured Hcy levels in a fraction of the participants, thereby, limiting their ability to test MTHFR genotype–Hcy interactions.[21,22] This study has yielded important new knowledge as highlighted below. 4.1. Association of tHcy with all-cause mortality in hypertensive adults Whereas a number of studies in western populations have consistently shown that elevated tHcy is a risk marker for all- cause mortality, the tHcy–mortality relationship in hypertensive patients has not been well-studied.[8] Similarly, in China, a 12- year community-based prospective study of 2009 Chinese participants found that Hcy was associated with all-cause mortality.[23] A recent study of 3799 Chinese patients with acute ischemic stroke found that elevated tHcy can predict 4-year mortality.[24] Whereas, in general, these studies support tHcy as a predictor of mortality, no study has speciﬁcally examined the effect of tHcy on mortality in Chinese hypertensive patients. Our study observed a dose–response relationship between baseline tHcy and all-cause mortality in Chinese hypertensive adults without pre-existing cardiovascular morbidities. This relationship persisted after adjusting for age, major cardiovascu- lar, and metabolic covariates or confounders, including baseline creatinine level.[14] This association also remained signiﬁcant after further adjusting for the MTHFR genotype. Our data provide coherent evidence that elevated tHcy level is an independent risk factor of all-cause mortality in Chinese hypertensive patients without pre-existing cardiovascular and cerebral comorbidities. 4.2. Effect modiﬁcation by the MTHFR C677T genotype Hcy is a sulfur-containing amino acid produced by the demethylation of the essential amino acid methionine. The MTHFR C677T polymorphism is a major determinant of blood Hcy.[25] However, questions remain to what degree the MTHFR genotype can modify the tHcy–mortality relationship.[8] Our study found that the MTHFR genotype alone had little effect on mortality. Our ﬁnding is consistent with a US prospective study of 6000 adults,[26] in which the MTHFR C677T TT genotype had no signiﬁcant effect on all-cause mortality after adjustment for ethnic group and other CVD risk factors. Two meta-analyses also found no signiﬁcant effect of the MTHFR genotype on vascular disease and longevity.[27,28] Our study was the ﬁrst to demonstrate a signiﬁcant interaction between MTHFR C677T genotypes and tHcy on all-cause mortality: the strength of association between tHcy and mortality was signiﬁcantly stronger in the CC/CT group than in the TT group. The utility of the MTHFR 677TT genotype in Mendelian randomization was proposed in a previous study.[16] However, our ﬁndings argue that the MTHFR C677T genotype should not be used as an independent marker in Mendelian randomization design, but rather should be incorporated to explore gene–environment interactions. 4.3. Biological mechanisms of tHcy in all-cause mortality The underlying biological mechanisms for tHcy to impact all- cause mortality remain to be determined and may likely involve multiple pathways. First, mildly or moderately elevated tHcy may be a marker of suspected causal risk factors for death, including aging, B-vitamin deﬁciency, and chronic kidney disease. However, we found that the tHcy–mortality association remained after adjusting for age, folate, vitamin B12, and creatinine levels. Whereas the prevailing view of the pathogenesis of elevated tHcy is focused on cardiovascular events, the signiﬁcant link between tHcy and all-cause mortality in hypertensive patients without pre-existing cardiovascular con- ditions strongly suggests a broader health effect. Indeed, hyperhomocysteinemia has been found to have a range of biological effects, including blunted nitric oxide bioactivity, enhanced generation of asymmetric dimethylarginine,[29] and increased reactive oxygen species, all of which can lead to endothelial dysfunction.[30] A better and more nuanced under- Table 3 Interaction of total homocysteine levels and MTHFR C677T genotype on all-cause mortality.

Limitations This study has limitations. Due to lack of data on speciﬁc causes of death, this study could not study cause-speciﬁc mortality. This study only assessed a 5-year mortality, and a second phase of the CSPPT with a longer follow-up is currently underway. This study focused on MTHFR C677T polymorphism; TT mutation is common in Chinese and is known to signiﬁcantly reduce MTHFR enzyme activity. There is another mutation, A1298C, in MTHFR gene, which we did not measure. However, A1298C mutation is very low (3.9%) in Chinese and its impact on the enzyme activity is weak.[31] Moreover, looking into other components in the homocysteine metabolic pathway, such as S-adenosylhomocysteine and adenosine, would provide further insight into homocysteine metabolism on mortality in the future.[32] Despite its large sample size, this study was underpowered for evaluating higher-order interactions. A larger sample size is required to adequately assess other potential effect modiﬁers, including age, sex, baseline glucose levels, cholesterol, and creatinine or estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFR), and concomitant use of other antidiabetic, antiplatelet, or antilipid medications. Additional analyses are needed to examine both baseline Hcy levels and Hcy lowering over the course of the trial on all-cause mortality. Although this study accounted for major covariables, the possibility of residual confounding cannot be excluded. Because the study population consisted of middle-aged or older Chinese hypertensive patients, caution is needed when generalizing the results to other populations. 4.5. Clinical and public health implications All-cause mortality is one of the most basic and important indicators of a population’s health, and is readily available from global and regional vital statistics. Although this study cannot provide a deﬁnitive answer on whether the observed tHcy–- mortality association is causal, the study ﬁndings are consistent with available literature and offer new insight into the role of tHcy and its interaction with the MTHFR variant on all-cause mortality in hypertensive patients without pre-existing condi- tions. The study ﬁndings have important clinical and public health implications in light of high prevalence of hypertension and elevated tHcy in China and worldwide. In China alone, there are approximately 300 million hypertensive patients and about 1 billion in the world. If further conﬁrmed that these study ﬁndings underscore the need to consider not only an individual’s tHcy but also the MTHFR genotype to more precisely assess future mortality risk, representing 1 small step towards the goal of precision medicine.[33] 5. Conclusions In this prospective analysis of Chinese adults with hypertension and without pre-existing cardiovascular and cerebral comorbid- ities, baseline tHcy predicted a 5-year all-cause mortality independent of major lifestyle, and cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors. Furthermore, the tHcy–mortality association was signiﬁcantly greater in those with the MTHFR CC/CT genotype compared with those with the TT genotype. These data underscore the need to consider both tHcy levels and the MTHFR genotype as biomarkers for predicting future mortality risk in hypertensive patients. References [1] Ganguly P, Alam SF.

Brown, MS; Ram D. Pathak, MD; Terry T.-K. Huang, PhD; Leslie Eiland, MD; Andjela Drincic, MD IMPORTANCE Rural populations have a higher prevalence of obesity and poor access to weight loss programs. Effective models for treating obesity in rural clinical practice are needed. OBJECTIVE To compare the Medicare Intensive Behavioral Therapy for Obesity fee-for-service model with 2 alternatives: in-clinic group visits based on a patient-centered medical home model and telephone-based group visits based on a disease management model. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cluster randomized trial conducted in 36 primary care practices in the rural Midwestern US. Inclusion criteria included age 20 to 75 years and body mass index of 30 to 45. Participants were enrolled from February 2016 to October 2017. Final follow-up occurred in December 2019. INTERVENTIONS All participants received a lifestyle intervention focused on diet, physical activity, and behavior change strategies. In the fee-for-service intervention (n = 473), practice-employed clinicians provided 15-minute in-clinic individual visits at a frequency similar to that reimbursed by Medicare (weekly for 1 month, biweekly for 5 months, and monthly thereafter). In the in-clinic group intervention (n = 468), practice-employed clinicians delivered group visits that were weekly for 3 months, biweekly for 3 months, and monthly thereafter. In the telephone group intervention (n = 466), patients received the same intervention as the in-clinic group intervention, but sessions were delivered remotely via conference calls by centralized staff. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was weight change at 24 months. A minimum clinically important difference was defined as 2.75 kg. RESULTS Among 1407 participants (mean age, 54.7 [SD, 11.8] years; baseline body mass index, 36.7 [SD, 4.0]; 1081 [77%] women), 1220 (87%) completed the trial. Mean weight loss at 24 months was –4.4 kg (95% CI, –5.5 to –3.4 kg) in the in-clinic group intervention, –3.9 kg (95% CI, –5.0 to –2.9 kg) in the telephone group intervention, and –2.6 kg (95% CI, –3.6 to –1.5 kg) in the in-clinic individual intervention. Compared with the in-clinic individual intervention, the mean difference in weight change was –1.9 kg (97.5% CI, –3.5 to –0.2 kg; P = .01) for the in-clinic group intervention and –1.4 kg (97.5% CI, –3.0 to 0.3 kg; P = .06) for the telephone group intervention. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with obesity in rural primary care clinics, in-clinic group visits but not telephone-based group visits, compared with in-clinic individual visits, resulted in statistically significantly greater weight loss at 24 months. However, the differences were small in magnitude and of uncertain clinical importance.

Group visits for obe- sity can also be delivered by telephone12,13 and integrated into callcentersthatprovideahighvolumeoftelephone-basedcare, such as those offered by disease management programs. Given the absence of direct evidence for the effectiveness of the Medicare Intensive Behavioral Therapy benefit and the continued need for alternative care delivery models suited for ruralpractices,theobjectiveofthisclusterrandomizedtrialwas to compare the effect of fee-for-service individual visit model with 2 alternatives, in-clinic group visits and telephone-based group visits, on weight change among adults with obesity. Methods The Rural Engagement in Primary Care for Optimizing Weight Reduction (REPOWER) trial was approved by institutional re- view boards at the University of Kansas Medical Center and the VA Nebraska–Western Iowa Health Care System. All partici- pants provided written informed consent. The trial was de- signed to be pragmatic.14 Thirty-six primary care practices that predominantly or exclusively served rural residents in the Midwestern US were randomly assigned by the study statis- tician using a computer-generated random number to 1 of 3 study groups in equal numbers, with randomization strati- fied by academic institutional affiliations (each primary care practice was affiliated with 1 of 3 different academic institu- tions). Randomization occurred after practices committed to the study. Three practices (2 randomized to in-clinic indi- vidual visits and 1 randomized to in-clinic group visits) de- clined participation after randomization but prior to patient enrollment for reasons unrelated to randomized assignment (study physician resigned for health reasons, staffing changes, and changes in data security requirements) and were subse- quentlyreplaced.Studydatawerecollectedandmanagedusing REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) tools hosted at the University of Kansas Medical Center. The trial protocol and sta- tistical analysis plan are available in Supplement 1. Participants Patientswereeligibleiftheywere20to75yearsold,hadabody massindexof30to45(calculatedasweightinkilogramsdivided by height in meters squared), resided in a rural location,15 and had at least 1 clinic visit within the prior 18 months. Exclusion criteria included a history of bariatric surgery and pregnancy, myocardialinfarction,stroke,ornewcancerdiagnosisinthelast 6months.Therewerenoexclusioncriteriaforrecentweightloss ormedicationsthataffectweight.Becauseobesitydisproportion- ally affects racial/ethnic minorities in rural communities,2 race andethnicityinformationwascollectedbasedonparticipantre- port using fixed categories with an open-ended option. Recruitment strategies included in-clinic referrals and di- rect mailings from clinic registries. Detailed recruitment meth- ods have been previously described.16 Interventions Diet, physical activity, and behavioral recommendations were the same across all study groups and were based on the Look AHEAD lifestyle intervention.17 Participants received a calorie goal (1200-1500 kcal/d if weight was <114 kg; 1500-1800 kcal/d if weight was ≥114 kg) and were instructed to consume a bal- anced diet with 5 or more fruit and vegetable servings per day. Portion control and optional use of protein shakes and frozen entrees were encouraged, but no food or scales were provided. Participants were instructed to increase planned physical ac- tivity up to 225 minutes per week, to set weekly diet and physi- cal activity goals, and to self-monitor daily with a physical ac- tivity monitor and commercial app or written log. Clinicians delivering the interventions were instructed to provide feed- back to participants on logs. Intervention materials addressed problem-solvingforovercomingbarriers,includingthosecom- mon to rural environments. The3deliverymodelsweredesignedtorepresenthowthey may be typically delivered in clinical practice, including the selection and training of counselors. A summary of visit, coun- selor, and training characteristics of the 3 models is shown in eTable 1 in Supplement 2. In-Clinic Individual Visits (Modified Medicare Intensive Behavioral Therapy Model) In this group, practice-employed clinicians provided 15- minute face-to-face individual counseling visits following the Key Points Question Does behavioral obesity treatment delivered in rural primary care settings via in-clinic group visits or telephone group visits improve weight loss compared with the fee-for-service model with in-clinic individual visits? Findings In this cluster randomized trial that included 1407 participants, in-clinic group visits, compared with in-clinic individual visits, resulted in significantly greater mean weight loss at 24 months (–4.4 kg vs –2.6 kg, respectively), and the difference between telephone-based group visits and in-clinic individual visits was not significantly different (–3.9 kg vs –2.6 kg). Meaning In rural primary care practices, behavioral weight loss therapy delivered via in-clinic group visits resulted in statistically significantly greater weight loss than in-clinic individual visits, although the difference was small and of uncertain clinical importance.

Two modi- fications were made to the Medicare provision: (1) partici- pants were not required to lose 3 kg or more by 6 months to receive additional visits and (2) visits remained monthly dur- ing year 2 rather than weekly to biweekly during months 13 to 18 as in the yearly benefit covered by Medicare. Each practice selected 1 to 2 counselors, most commonly nurses, who con- ducted visits according to Medicare billing requirements, in which coverage is allowed if the primary care clinician is physi- callypresentinthesettingwhencounselingisdelivered.18Only 1 physician was selected to serve as a counselor. Counselors received a 1-time 3-hour training focused on diet and physi- cal activity guidelines, behavioral strategies, and motiva- tionalinterviewing.Eachpracticereceivedaninterventiontool kit including example sessions and patient handouts. In-Clinic Group Visits Inthisgroup,practice-employedcliniciansdeliveredgroupvis- its at the practice, with a median of 14 patients per group. Vis- its were 60 minutes and were weekly for the first 3 months, every other week for months 4 to 6, and monthly thereafter. This frequency was based on group-based interventions and experiencefromtheRuralLITEtrialcomparing3dosesofgroup visits.19 The first 14 sessions were delivered face-to-face. For subsequent sessions, practices had the option to switch to group telephone conference calls; however, all but 1 practice opted to continue face-to-face visits. Between 1 and 3 coun- selors were selected locally, predominantly nurses, and in- cluded only 1 physician. Counselors received the same 1-time training plus a group treatment manual with accompanying patientmanuals,a1-dayin-personworkshopfocusedongroup facilitation, and optional biweekly to monthly telementoring sessions. Fidelity monitoring was limited following a prag- matic approach. Study personnel observed counselors once, and counselors completed a checklist for each visit document- ing attendance and completion of core components. Counsel- ors were encouraged to incorporate community resources. Telephone Group Visits Patients at practices randomized to telephone group visits re- ceived the same group-based lifestyle intervention, but ses- sions were delivered remotely via audio-only telephone con- ference calls by centralized study staff with graduate degrees in relevant fields (eg, nutrition, exercise science, psychol- ogy).Thetreatmentmanual,sessionfrequency,sessionlength, and group size were the same as for the in-clinic group inter- vention (median group size of 14 patients per group). Train- ing included shadowing an experienced counselor, weekly to monthly staff meetings, and fidelity monitoring through re- viewofrecordedsessions;counselorsalsocompletedthesame intervention session checklist as those conducting in-clinic group intervention sessions. Role of Primary Care Clinicians The role of the local primary care physicians (and advanced practice clinicians who served as the primary study clinicians at5practices)acrossallgroupswastoreferpatientstothestudy and support patients during routine medical visits. Clinicians received a 1-time training on obesity treatment guidelines. At practicesrandomizedtoin-clinicindividualandin-clinicgroup visits, documentation of intervention sessions occurred in the electronicmedicalrecordaccordingtolocalprocesses.Fortele- phone group visits, remote counselors sent 5 progress re- ports to participants’ clinicians documenting weight change to date, known barriers and motivators, and concise recom- mendations for clinician action (eg, praise weight loss; dis- cuss plans to maintain tracking and exercise). Outcomes Weight was measured at baseline and at 6, 18, and 24 months by trained staff at each practice using a calibrated study scale (MX-115;BefourInc)withthepatientinlightclothingoragown. There were 2 primary comparisons: change in weight at month 24 between the in-clinic group intervention vs the in-clinic individual visit intervention and between the telephone group intervention vs the in-clinic individual visit intervention. Secondary outcomes included percentage weight loss at each follow-up visit, the proportion of participants achieving 5% and 10% weight loss at 6- and 24-month follow-up, and com- parisons between in-clinic group visits and telephone group visits. Interim time points leading up to 24 months (6 and 18 months) were not explicitly prespecified in the protocol for absolute change in weight. A weight change of 2.75 kg is con- sistent with a minimum clinically important difference,20 although this is not stated in the protocol. The proportions achieving weight loss thresholds of 5% and 10% at 6- and 24-month follow-up were added as secondary outcomes near theendofthetrialpriortodatareview.(Intheprotocol[Supple- ment 1], the analytical plan for all weight-related outcomes, both primary and secondary, are described under a heading indicating primary aims only.) Additional secondary out- comes not reported in this article include heterogeneity of treatment effects by participant characteristics (race, educa- tion,income,employmentstatus,traveltime,historyofweight loss), change in blood pressure, fasting glucose and lipids, pa- tient-reported quality of life, sleep, and stress, and explor- atory process measures to evaluate patient reach and practice- level sustainability of the interventions. Statistical Analysis Analyses used linear mixed-effects multilevel models, which included random cluster (clinic) effects, to examine absolute change in weight and percentage weight loss over time. An un- structured covariance matrix was used. Participants were ana- lyzed according to randomized group, models included par- ticipants with baseline weight data, and missing weight data were treated as missing at random and addressed using maxi- mum likelihood methods. Generalized linear mixed models were used to compare the percentage of participants achiev- ing 5% and 10% thresholds. Models included randomization strata based on affiliated academic institution. Prespecified sensitivity analysis adjusted for covariates that showed im- balance between groups based on a standardized difference greater than 0.20 for the following variables: sex, race/ ethnicity, education, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and Effect of Behavioral Therapy With In-Clinic or Telephone Group Visits vs In-Clinic Individual Visits on Weight Loss in Obesity Original Investigation Research jama.com (Reprinted) JAMA January 26, 2021 Volume 325, Number 4 365 © 2021 American Medical Association.

The threshold of standardized differ- ence of greater than 0.20 for defining imbalanced covariates was defined post hoc. Three additional post hoc sensitivity analyses were conducted: adjusting for baseline weight, im- puting baseline weight for missing 24-month weight data, and excluding the single Veterans Administration (VA) clinic (the onlypracticerandomizedtoin-clinicgroupvisitsthatswitched to telephone group visits after 14 sessions [4 months] as al- lowed per protocol). With 36 clinics, approximately 40 pa- tients per practice, and an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.05, the trial had at least 80% power to detect a net treat- ment effect of 2.75 kg at 24 months (determined from effects observed in prior trials21,22 and consistent with a minimum clinically important difference).20 For the 2 primary compari- sons(in-clinicgroupvisitsvsin-clinicindividualvisits,andtele- phone group visits vs in-clinic individual visits), a 2-sided sig- nificance level was set at .025 with Bonferroni correction. For secondary outcomes and comparisons, α was set at .05. Be- cause of the potential for type I error due to multiple compari- sons, findings for secondary end points and analyses should be interpreted as exploratory. Analyses were conducted with SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc). Results Of the 36 included practices, 10 were rural health clinics and 12 were federally qualified health centers. Twenty-two prac- tices were located in isolated or small rural areas. eTable 2 in Supplement 2 shows practice characteristics. A total of 1931 patients were screened and 1432 were en- rolled (Figure 1). Participants had a mean age of 54.7 (SD, 11.8) yearsandameanbodymassindexof36.7(SD,4.0);76.8%were female,96.2%wereWhitenon-Hispanic,and46.8%werefrom anisolatedruralarea15(Table1).Participantsremovedfromthe study (n = 25; for pregnancy [n = 9], bariatric surgery [n = 4], major medical contraindications [n = 9], or death [n = 3]) were excluded from analyses a priori. Among the remaining 1407 participants, 86.7% completed testing at 24-month follow-up (86.7% in the in-clinic individual, 87.6% in the in-clinic group, and 85.8% in the telephone group interventions). Primary Outcomes At 24 months, mean weight loss was –4.4 kg (95% CI, –5.5 to –3.4kg)forin-clinicgroupvisits,–3.9kg(95%CI,–5.0to–2.9kg) for telephone group visits, and –2.6 kg (95% CI, –3.6 to –1.5 kg) for in-clinic individual visits (Figure 2 and Table 2). Com- pared with in-clinic individual visits, the difference in mean weight change was –1.9 kg (97.5% CI, –3.5 to –0.2 kg; P = .01) for in-clinic group visits and –1.4 kg (97.5% CI, –3.0 to 0.3 kg; P = .06) for telephone group visits. Secondary Outcomes At 6-month follow-up, mean weight loss was –8.3 kg (95% CI, –9.2 to –7.4 kg) for in-clinic group visits, –7.7 kg (95% CI, –8.6 to –6.8 kg) for telephone group visits, and –5.7 kg (95% CI, –6.7 to –4.8 kg) for in-clinic individual visits. Compared with in-clinic individual visits, the difference in mean weight change was –2.6 kg (95% CI, –3.8 to –1.4 kg; P < .001) for in-clinic group vis- its and –2.0 kg (95% CI, –3.2 to –0.8 kg; P = .002) for telephone group visits (eTable 3 in Supplement 2). There were no signifi- cant differences between in-clinic group and telephone group visits with regard to mean weight loss at any time point. Pre- specifiedsensitivityanalysiswithadjustmentforbaselinechar- acteristics, as well as post hoc sensitivity analyses with adjust- ment for baseline weight, imputation of baseline weight for missingweightdata,andexcludingthesingleVAsite,allshowed similar findings (eTable 4 in Supplement 2). At 24 months, there was no significant difference in the proportion of participants who achieved clinically meaning- ful weight loss greater than 5% between in-clinic group visits (44.1% [95% CI, 35.2%-47.8%]) and in-clinic individual visits (36.0% [95% CI, 30.2%-42.3%]; odds ratio [OR], 1.4 [95% CI, 1.0-2.0];P = .07)orbetweentelephonegroupvisits(41.4%[95% CI, 37.9%-50.6%]) and in-clinic individual visits (OR, 1.3 [95% CI, 0.9-1.8]; P = .22). At 24 months, there was no significant difference in the proportion who achieved greater than 10% weight loss between in-clinic group visits (22.6% [95% CI, 18.1%-27.9%]) and in-clinic individual visits (17.1% [95% CI, 13.3%-21.8%]; OR, 1.4 [95% CI, 0.9-2.1]; P = .09) or between telephone group visits (22.3% [95% CI, 17.9%-27.6%]) and in- clinic individual visits (OR, 1.4 [95% CI, 0.9-2.1]; P = .11). Per- centageweightlossandproportionswhoachievedgreaterthan 5% and greater than 10% weight loss at 6 and 18 months are shown in eTable 5 in Supplement 2. Comparisons of those who achieved greater than 5% and greater than 10% weight loss at 18 months were post hoc. Session Attendance Mean attendance rates for in-clinic individual visits, in-clinic group visits, and telephone group visits were 12.1 of 14 visits (86.4%),12.7of18visits(71.6%),and11.7of18visits(66.2%)from 0to6monthsand10.6of18visits(58.9%),7.4of18visits(40.9%), and 6.6 of 18 visits (35.9%) from 6 to 24 months (Table 3). Adverse Events Three unrelated deaths and 261 hospitalizations were re- ported, including 94 for the in-clinic individual intervention, 88 for the in-clinic group intervention, and 82 for the tele- phone group intervention. Only 3 events were determined to be possibly study related (2 joint replacements and 1 chole- cystectomy), and 1 probably related (recurrent syncope) (eTable 6 in Supplement 2). Discussion In this trial, in-clinic group visits, but not telephone group vis- its, resulted in statistically significant greater weight loss at 24 months compared with a modified Medicare Intensive Behav- ioral Therapy model with traditional in-clinic individual visits. Results also demonstrated no significant difference in the pro- portion of participants attaining weight loss greater than 5%, a clinically important change, at 24 months for any of the be- tween-group comparisons.

In-clinic individual visits had a higher proportion of at- tendance,particularlyatlatertimepoints,comparedwithboth in-clinic group visits and telephone group visits, although this intervention did not result in greater weight loss. Attendance was not due to payment incentives. Participants were not paid, and practice staff were paid per visit similarly across interven- tiongroups.Inaddition,traveltimetoclinicswassimilaracross groups. The flexible scheduling of individual visits, and per- haps the greater attention to individual needs with one-on- one interaction, may have led to greater attendance. In both group interventions, participants chose from approximately 3 to 4 meeting time options, mostly before- or after-hours; however, changes in participants’ schedules may have hin- dered attendance over 2 years. Thus, the benefits of group vis- its (eg, peer support and accountability) may be most pro- nounced during initial treatment as supported by the larger between-group weight losses observed at 6 months, as is typi- callytrueofweightlossinterventions.Datapresentedheresug- gestthatpeerinteractioningroupvisitsmaynotleadtogreater attendance compared with individual visits.

Research Original Investigation Effect of Behavioral Therapy With In-Clinic or Telephone Group Visits vs In-Clinic Individual Visits on Weight Loss in Obesity 368 JAMA January 26, 2021 Volume 325, Number 4 (Reprinted) jama.com © 2021 American Medical Association.

Ex- cept at the single VA clinic, patients and clinicians in the in- clinic group intervention preferred to continue meeting in per- son rather than switch to telephone group calls after 14 visits. Furtherresearchiswarrantedontheactualandperceivedtravel burden of rural residents, particularly in light of the potential benefits of attending visits in a health care setting with a clini- cian who has expertise in the local community. Wadden et al25 recently evaluated the intensive behav- ioral therapy provision among 50 adults in an academic set- ting outside of primary care and found that a similar propor- tion achieved greater than 5% weight loss after 12 months (44%). Other studies of primary care–based interventions with individual telephone visits observed weight loss ranging from –4.0 kg to –4.6 kg at 12 to 24 months.21,26,27 The Look AHEAD intervention, which took place in academic-based settings, re- ported a 6.5% mean weight loss at 24 months.28 Some of the Look AHEAD intervention components, such as more fre- quent visits, offering a combination of group and individual visits, or providing meal replacement shakes, may improve the weight loss observed across the 3 delivery strategies. In addi- tion, remote delivery through home-based telemedicine/ televideo may offer advantages over audio-only conference calls, and the scalability of this approach is relevant to both rural and urban settings. The Medicare Intensive Behavioral Therapy benefit could be adapted to support group visits, tele- medicine visits, or some combination of visit types. This trial was designed to have a high degree of prag- matic elements to enhance the likelihood that the findings would be generalizable to clinical practice. Practices repre- sented a diverse mix of practice types across a wide geo- graphic region. In addition, patients were recruited through clinic registries and referrals rather than by research staff, and therewerefewexclusioncriteriaandahigheligibilityrate(87% of those screened).16 Practice-employed staff delivered the in- terventioneventhoughfewhadpriorexperienceinweightloss counseling. Also, the training was designed to represent the amount of time a practitioner might take off from clinical care, and fidelity monitoring was limited to the centralized tele- phone group model. To our knowledge, this was the first prag- matic trial comparing the Medicare reimbursable model with in-clinic group and telephone group visits. To our knowl- edge, this trial was the largest trial implementing behavioral weight loss interventions within local practices. Limitations This study has several limitations. First, the sample was pre- dominantly White non-Hispanic and mostly female. However, the proportion of men was similar to other weight loss trials,29 and the race/ethnicity of the sample represents the population within the participating rural practices.16 Second, the study did not have a control group that did not receive a weight loss intervention. Third, the study was designed to compare cur- rent care delivery models under pragmatic conditions and thus Figure 2.

More negative values indicate greater weight loss. Mean weights at baseline were 102.9 (SD, 15.5) kg for the in-clinic group intervention, 102.7 (SD, 15.6) kg for the telephone group intervention, and 103.1 (SD, 15.4) kg for the in-clinic individual intervention. Analyses used linear mixed-effects multilevel models, which included random cluster (clinic) effects, and adjusted for randomized strata (affiliated academic medical center) to examine the primary outcome of group comparison of absolute change in weight at 24 months. An unstructured covariance matrix was used, and missing weights were treated as missing at random and addressed using maximum likelihood methods. The primary outcome, the difference in mean weight change at 24 months compared with in-clinic individual visits was –1.9 kg (97.5% CI, –3.5 to –0.2 kg; P = .01) for in-clinic group visits and –1.4 kg (97.5% CI, –3.0 to 0.3 kg; P = .06) for telephone group visits. There were no significant differences between in-clinic group visits and telephone group visits.

Enhanced training for clini- cians delivering individual in-clinic visits may improve out- comes for this model.30 Fourth, the study was not limited to older adults covered by Medicare and did not require a greater than 3-kg weight loss for continued sessions; thus, replication oftheintensivebehavioraltherapyprovisionisneededinaMedi- care population.

BACKGROUND High-flow oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula has been increasingly used in  infants with bronchiolitis, despite limited high-quality evidence of its efficacy. The  efficacy of high-flow oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula in settings other  than intensive care units (ICUs) is unclear. METHODS In this multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, we assigned infants younger  than 12 months of age who had bronchiolitis and a need for supplemental oxygen  therapy to receive either high-flow oxygen therapy (high-flow group) or standard  oxygen therapy (standard-therapy group). Infants in the standard-therapy group  could receive rescue high-flow oxygen therapy if their condition met criteria for  treatment failure. The primary outcome was escalation of care due to treatment  failure (defined as meeting ≥3 of 4 clinical criteria: persistent tachycardia, tachy- pnea, hypoxemia, and medical review triggered by a hospital early-warning tool).  Secondary outcomes included duration of hospital stay, duration of oxygen therapy,  and rates of transfer to a tertiary hospital, ICU admission, intubation, and adverse  events. RESULTS The analyses included 1472 patients. The percentage of infants receiving escalation  of care was 12% (87 of 739 infants) in the high-flow group, as compared with 23%  (167 of 733) in the standard-therapy group (risk difference, −11 percentage points;  95% confidence interval, −15 to −7; P<0.001). No significant differences were ob- served in the duration of hospital stay or the duration of oxygen therapy. In each  group, one case of pneumothorax (<1% of infants) occurred. Among the 167 in- fants in the standard-therapy group who had treatment failure, 102 (61%) had a  response to high-flow rescue therapy. CONCLUSIONS Among infants with bronchiolitis who were treated outside an ICU, those who  received high-flow oxygen therapy had significantly lower rates of escalation of  care due to treatment failure than those in the group that received standard  oxygen therapy.

In the United States, bronchiolitis is  responsible for $1.7 billion in hospitalization costs  annually.1,2 In Australia and New Zealand, there  has been a population-based increase in admis- sions to the intensive care unit (ICU) for bron- chiolitis, with associated increases in hospital  costs.3 Numerous studies have investigated the role of  medical therapies4 in infants with bronchiolitis;  none of these interventions have shown efficacy.5  The American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines  recommend only supportive therapy that includes  oxygen therapy for hypoxemia, respiratory sup- port, and the maintenance of hydration.5,6 Respiratory support as provided in emergency  and ward settings has been limited to oxygen  delivered through a standard nasal cannula, at a  rate of up to 2 liters of 100% oxygen per minute,  to treat hypoxemia.7 The hallmark of severe  bronchiolitis is small airway inflammation re- sulting in hypoxemia, hypercarbia, and increased  work of breathing,1 all of which respond to the  provision of positive pressure. However, respira- tory support involving continuous positive air- way pressure, intubation, and mechanical venti- lation8-10 has traditionally been restricted to the  intensive care setting. High-flow oxygen therapy through a nasal  cannula has emerged as a new method to pro- vide respiratory support for respiratory diseases  in neonates, infants, children, and adults.11-13  Humidified and heated air that is blended with  oxygen and delivered through a nasal cannula  provides a degree of positive airway pressure.14,15  Observational and physiological studies suggest  that decreased work of breathing,16 improved  oxygenation, and reduced rates of intubation are  associated with high-flow oxygen therapy.17,18 We  conducted a multicenter, randomized trial to test  whether early treatment with high-flow therapy  in infants with bronchiolitis and hypoxemia in  emergency departments and general pediatric  wards would result in fewer infants having  treatment failure that leads to the escalation  of care. Methods Trial Design and Oversight Emergency departments and general pediatric  inpatient units in 17 tertiary and regional hospi- tals in Australia and New Zealand participated  in the trial. The human research ethics commit- tee at each participating site approved the trial.  The protocol, available with the full text of this  article at NEJM.org, has been published previous- ly.19 The trial was overseen by a steering commit- tee with a principal investigator at each site. The  authors vouch for the accuracy and complete- ness of the data and for the fidelity of the trial  to the protocol. The first drafts of the manu- script were written by the first and last authors  with input from all the authors. Although the  intervention could not be masked, all the inves- tigators remained unaware of the trial outcome  until all the data were locked at the end of trial  in December 2016, after the analysis of data  from all recruited patients. The high-flow equip- ment and consumables for all the trial sites were  donated by Fisher and Paykel Healthcare, which  had no involvement in the design and conduct  of the trial, the analysis of the data, or in the  preparation of the manuscript or the decision to  submit it for publication. Patients Infants younger than 12 months of age were  eligible for inclusion on presentation to an emer- gency department or inpatient unit if they had  clinical signs of bronchiolitis and a need for  supplemental oxygen therapy to keep the oxygen- saturation level in the range of 92 to 98% (or 94  to 98% at the 11 hospitals with higher satura- tion thresholds for intervention in hypoxemia,  in alignment with their institutional practice).  Bronchiolitis in an infant was defined according  to the American Academy of Pediatrics20 criteria as  symptoms of respiratory distress associated with  symptoms of a viral respiratory tract infection.5  We excluded critically ill infants who had an im- mediate need for respiratory support and ICU  admission; infants with cyanotic heart disease,  basal skull fracture, upper airway obstruction,  or craniofacial malformation; and infants who  were receiving oxygen therapy at home.

At the time of the trial, high-flow therapy  was considered to be the normal standard prac- tice in the trial centers; therefore, the ethics com- mittee allowed the deferred-consent process. Randomization A computer-generated randomization sequence  with a block size of 10 was used, and infants  were stratified according to participating center.  Sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes  containing the treatment assignment (in a 1:1  ratio) were opened when eligibility criteria were  met. Masking of the assigned treatment was not  possible, given the visually obvious differences  between the two interventions. Trial Interventions Infants in the high-flow group received heated  and humidified high-flow oxygen at a rate of  2 liters per kilogram of body weight per minute,  delivered by the Optiflow system with the use of  an age-appropriate Optiflow Junior cannula and  the Airvo 2 high-flow system (Fisher and Paykel  Healthcare). The fraction of inspired oxygen  (Fio2) for high-flow use was adjusted to obtain  oxygen-saturation levels in the range of 92 to  98% (or 94 to 98% at the 11 hospitals with  higher saturation thresholds). Weaning of the  Fio2 to the level of ambient air (0.21) was permit- ted at any time to provide the lowest possible  oxygen percentage to maintain an oxygen-satu- ration level of at least 92% (or ≥94% in the 11  specified hospitals). High-flow oxygen therapy  was stopped after 4 hours of receiving an Fio2 of  0.21 while oxygen levels were maintained in the  expected range. Infants in the standard-therapy group received  supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula,  up to a maximum of 2 liters per minute, to main- tain an oxygen-saturation level in the range of  92 to 98% (or 94 to 98%, depending on institu- tional practice). Weaning from supplemental  oxygen was permitted at any time to provide the  lowest possible oxygen level delivered to main- tain an oxygen-saturation level of at least 92%  (or ≥94%). Enteral feeding was recommended, depending  on the clinician’s preference. Oral intake of food  (liquid or solid) was allowed, particularly during  weaning from the treatment. Trial Outcomes The primary outcome was treatment failure that  resulted in escalation of care during that hospi- tal admission. At the point of care, the treating  clinicians determined the presence of treatment  failure if at least three of four clinical criteria  were met and clinicians decided that escalation  of care was required. The criteria were as follows:  the heart rate remained unchanged or increased  by any amount since admission (by contrast, a  decrease of >5 beats per minute or into the nor- mal range indicated treatment success); the re- spiratory rate remained unchanged or increased  by any amount since admission (by contrast, a  decrease of >5 breaths per minute or into the  normal range indicated treatment success); the  oxygen requirement in the high-flow group  exceeded an Fio2 of at least 0.4 to maintain an  oxygen-saturation level of at least 92% (or ≥94%,  depending on the institution) or the requirement  for supplemental oxygen in the standard-therapy  group exceeded 2 liters per minute to maintain  an oxygen-saturation level of at least 92% (or  ≥94%); and the hospital internal early-warning  tool triggered a medical review and escalation of  care (see below). Clinicians were allowed to es- calate therapy if they were concerned for other  clinical reasons that were not captured in the  four clinical criteria. All the participating hospitals used an early- warning tool to trigger escalation of care, with  11 of the 17 centers using an identical scoring  system and 6 using comparable systems (see Sec- tion 4.14 in the Supplementary Appendix). The  early-warning tools were all based on multiple  physiological and clinical variables that mandated  medical review and escalation of care when lim- its were breached. Escalation of treatment or the  level of care was defined as an increase in respi- ratory support or transfer to an ICU. For infants  in the standard-therapy group who received es- calation of care, it was suggested to change to  The New England Journal of Medicine  Downloaded from nejm.org on March 21, 2018.

Prespecified secondary outcomes included the  proportion of infants who were transferred to an  ICU, which included admission to an on-site ICU  or transfer to an ICU at a tertiary hospital; the  duration of hospital stay; the duration of ICU  stay; the duration of oxygen therapy; intubation  rates; and adverse events. Data regarding treat- ment that was not specified as part of the trial  were recorded, as were data regarding medica- tions. The nine centers that had no on-site ICU  had to transport infants who required intensive  care to a hospital that provided these pediatric  services. A serious adverse event was defined as  any event that was fatal, life-threatening, perma- nently disabling, or incapacitating or that resulted  in a prolonged hospital stay. Statistical Analysis Assuming a baseline rate of treatment failure of  10% in the standard-therapy group and a 50%  lower rate (5%) in the high-flow group, we cal- culated that 582 infants per group would provide  the trial with 90% power at a type I error of 0.05  to show a rate of treatment failure that was sig- nificantly lower with high-flow therapy than with  standard therapy (see Section 4.4 in the Supple- mentary Appendix). Assuming a rate of with- drawal or loss to follow-up of approximately 10 to  20%, we calculated an overall sample size of 1400.  The primary and secondary outcomes were ana- lyzed on the basis of the assigned treatment  group. Data were analyzed first for all infants who  received escalation of care. Data were then ana- lyzed again for all infants who received escala- tion of care and for whom secondary chart re- view independently confirmed that at least three  of the four clinical criteria for treatment failure  had been met. Descriptive statistics were used to  report the baseline characteristics of the total  trial cohort, according to treatment group. The  primary outcome measure for the investigation  of the escalation of care due to treatment failure  was analyzed with the use of a chi-square test  and was reported as the relative risk and the risk  difference with 95% confidence intervals and  P values. The continuous outcome measure of  the duration of hospital stay was approximately  normally distributed; hence, Student’s t-test of  independent samples was used. Analyses of sec- ondary outcomes were based on the chi-square  test for proportions and on Student’s t-tests of  independent samples for continuous measures. Prespecified subgroups included infants who  had been born prematurely (at <37 weeks of ges- tation), infants with a previous hospital admission  for respiratory disease, infants with a congenital  heart defect, infants younger than 3 months of  age and those younger than 6 months of age  (with correction for prematurity), and infants  presenting to hospitals with an on-site ICU and  those without an on-site ICU. A test for interac- tion between treatment group and subgroup on  the basis of a log binomial regression model was  used to test for homogeneity of relative risks  between subgroups. If there was no evidence of  heterogeneity in a subgroup analysis, the overall  relative risk was assumed for that subgroup.  Exploratory analyses involved patients who re- ceived escalation of care. Results Characteristics of the Patients Infants were recruited between October 2013  and August 2016. A total of 2217 infants were  eligible for inclusion, of whom 1638 (74%) un- derwent randomization (Fig. 1). A total of 210  parents or guardians (12%) declined consent  (166 with deferred consent and 44 with immedi- ate consent); thus, 1472 infants were included in  the analyses. The baseline demographic and  physiological characteristics of the infants were  similar in the two groups (Table 1, and Table  S1A and S1B in the Supplementary Appendix).  Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most  common virus detected, and premature birth  was the most common coexisting condition. Primary Outcome Treatment failure with escalation of care oc- curred in 87 of 739 infants (12%) in the high- flow group, as compared with 167 of 733 (23%)  in the standard-therapy group (risk difference,  −11 percentage points; 95% confidence interval  [CI], −15 to −7; P<0.001). The Kaplan–Meier plot  showed a higher rate of treatment success among  infants treated with high-flow oxygen therapy  than among those who received standard oxygen  therapy, and a log-rank test confirmed a lower  The New England Journal of Medicine  Downloaded from nejm.org on March 21, 2018.

Among infants who  had treatment failure, the interval between en- rollment and escalation of care did not differ  significantly between the two groups (Table 2).  The number needed to treat to prevent one   instance of escalation of care was 9 (95% CI,  7 to 14). The effect of the intervention on escalation  of care was independent of age. The treatment  effect of the intervention differed significantly  between hospitals with an on-site ICU and those  without an on-site ICU (P<0.001). In hospitals  without an on-site ICU, escalation of care oc- curred in 20 of 270 infants (7%) in the high-flow  group, as compared with 69 of 247 (28%) in the  standard-therapy group (risk difference, −21 per- centage points; 95% CI, −27 to −14). However, in  hospitals with an on-site ICU, escalation of care  occurred in 67 of 469 (14%) in the high-flow  group and in 98 of 486 (20%) in the standard- therapy group (risk difference, −6 percentage  points; 95% CI, −11 to −1). Analyses that consid- ered a history of prematurity or previous hospi- tal admission showed no effect on the primary  outcome. There were no significant differences  in outcome between RSV-positive infants and  RSV-negative infants. The results were similar in all the infants  receiving escalation of care who were indepen- dently confirmed to meet at least three of the  four clinical criteria for treatment failure (Ta- ble 2, and Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appen- dix). According to independent chart review,  clinicians escalated therapy in 86 of 254 infants  (34%; 34 infants in the high-flow group and  52 in the standard-therapy group) who did not  meet three of the four prespecified clinical cri- teria. A total of 53 infants in the high-flow  group (7%) met this threshold and received  escalation of care, as compared with 115 (16%)  in the standard-therapy group (risk difference, −9  percentage points; 95% CI, −12 to −5; P<0.001)  (Table 2). The severity of disease as measured  immediately before the time of escalation of  care was similar in the two trial groups with  regard to the absolute heart rate and the trans- cutaneous oxygen saturation level; however, the  respiratory rate was significantly higher in the  high-flow group than in the standard-therapy  group (Table 3). The most common reason that  triggered escalation of care was the hospital  early-warning tool. The proportion of infants  meeting the clinical criteria triggering escala- tion of care was similar in hospitals with an  on-site ICU and in those without an on-site ICU  Figure 1.

There  were no primary-outcome differences in the  subgroups (Table S3 in the Supplementary Ap- pendix). Secondary Outcomes There were no significant between-group differ- ences in the duration of hospital stay, the dura- tion of stay in the ICU, or the duration of oxygen  therapy (Table 3, and Fig. S2A and S2B in the  Supplementary Appendix). In all 167 infants in  the standard-therapy group who had treatment  failure and received escalation of care, clinicians  opted to offer high-flow therapy as a rescue  treatment. Among these 167 infants, 102 (61%)  had a response to high-flow rescue therapy; in  65 infants (39%), rescue high-flow therapy was  ineffective, and the infants were transferred to  an ICU. Overall, 35 infants (2%) were transferred  from a hospital without an on-site ICU to an- other hospital. A total of 12 infants (1%) under- went intubation, including 8 infants in the high- flow group and 4 in the standard-therapy group  (P = 0.39). Data regarding medications are pro- vided in Table S4 in the Supplementary Appen- dix. The rate of adverse events was low in each  group, with one pneumothorax occurring in  each group (no drainage needed). No life-threat- ening serious adverse events were observed, in- cluding no instances of emergency intubation or  cardiac arrest. Discussion In this multicenter, randomized, controlled trial  involving infants with bronchiolitis and hypox- emia, we found that significantly fewer infants  in the high-flow group than in the standard- therapy group received escalation of care. There  was no significant between-group difference in  the incidence of adverse events. There was no  evidence of a shorter duration of oxygen therapy,  lower rate of ICU admission, or shorter duration  of hospital stay in infants receiving high-flow  oxygen therapy than in those receiving standard  subnasal oxygen therapy. Our findings are supported by the results of  a recent smaller trial,21 which showed a similar  effect size, with a lower treatment-failure rate in  the high-flow group than in the standard-therapy  group (14% vs. 33%). No significant differences  in the duration of oxygen therapy and the dura- tion of hospital stay were found in that trial. As  in our trial, clinicians were allowed to use res- cue high-flow oxygen therapy for infants in the  standard-therapy group if they had treatment  failure. Oxygen-saturation levels of less than  90% were an exclusion criterion. In contrast, our  trial specifically targeted infants with hypox- emia and bronchiolitis, and we excluded infants  with acutely life-threatening bronchiolitis lead- ing to immediate respiratory support and intu- bation. The primary outcome in our pragmatic trial  included escalation of care and the meeting of at  least three of four clinical criteria. Escalation of  care was allowed if clinically warranted in the  judgment of the treating clinician; this was nec- essary as a safeguard, given that our trial tested  an intervention that had been previously per- formed only in ICUs. Clinicians escalated care in  34% of the infants who did not meet at least  three of the four prespecified clinical criteria,  according to the independent chart review we  conducted.

The trial protocol did not offer any “rescue”  option in the general inpatient unit for infants  who had treatment failure with high-flow ther- apy; these infants were all admitted directly to a  pediatric ICU. The overall rate of ICU admissions  was lower than rates in a previous report2; only  1% of the patients in our trial underwent intuba- tion (Table 3). Our study had certain limitations. It was not  possible to mask the oxygen-delivery method. To  minimize bias, we used prespecified clinical  criteria for the escalation of care. This pragmatic  design reflects current practice across many insti- tutions. The rescue use of high-flow oxygen  therapy reflected a real-world scenario, because  high-flow therapy was used as standard practice  in Australia and New Zealand at the time of our  trial. Denying clinicians the option to use res- cue high-flow oxygen therapy in infants in the  standard-oxygen group would have prevented us  from performing the trial. In conclusion, our randomized, controlled  trial involving infants with bronchiolitis showed  a significantly lower rate of escalation of care due  to treatment failure when high-flow oxygen ther- apy was used early during the hospital admission  than when standard oxygen therapy was used.

Khiew,*,1 Cynthia Louis,*,† Andrew J. Fleetwood,* Adrian Achuthan,* Irmgard Fo¨rster,‡ Andrew D. Cook,*,2 and John A. Hamilton*,2 Pain is one of the most debilitating symptoms in many diseases for which there is inadequate management and understanding. CSF-1, also known as M-CSF, acts via its receptor (CSF-1R, c-Fms) to regulate the development of the monocyte/macrophage lineage and to act locally in tissues to control macrophage numbers and function. It has been implicated in the control of neuropathic pain via a central action on microglia. We report in this study that systemic administration of a neutralizing anti–CSF-1R or CSF-1 mAb inhibits the development of inﬂammatory pain induced by zymosan, GM-CSF, and TNF in mice. This approach also prevented but did not ameliorate the development of arthritic pain and optimal disease driven by the three stimuli in mice, suggesting that CSF-1 may only be relevant when the driving inﬂammatory insults in tissues are acute and/or periodic. Systemic CSF-1 administration rapidly induced pain and enhanced the arthritis in an inﬂamed mouse joint, albeit via a different pathway(s) from that used by systemic GM-CSF and TNF. It is concluded that CSF-1 can function peripherally during the generation of inﬂammatory pain and hence may be a target for such pain and associated disease, including when the clinically important cytokines, TNF and GM-CSF, are involved. Our ﬁndings have ramiﬁcations for the selection and design of anti–CSF-1R/CSF-1 trials. The Journal of Immunology, 2018, 201: 2042–2053. P ain is one of the most severe symptoms associated with inﬂammatory/autoimmune diseases, ultimately leading to functional impairment, disability, and poor quality of life and is the major symptom for which patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), for example, want effective treatment. RA is an autoimmune-mediated, inﬂammatory joint disease characterized by an abundance of macrophages, with there being a positive correlation between synovial macrophage numbers and RA se- verity (1–3). RA pain is believed to arise from multiple mecha- nisms, involving inﬂammation, peripheral and central pain processing, and structural changes within the joint (4). Inﬂam- matory cytokines and/or algesic mediators produced by immune cells, such as synovial macrophages, and/or by components of the nervous system are thought to be a major cause of such pain (5–9). CSF-1, also known as M-CSF, is a member of the hematopoietic CSF family, is ubiquitously expressed in the steady state, and is a key regulator for the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of macrophage lineage populations, including osteoclasts (3, 10– 14). The CSF-1R is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase (c-Fms) and is most highly expressed on the surface of cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage (12, 15). Studies using neutral- izing anti–CSF-1R mAb blockade have suggested that in the steady state in the adult, CSF-1 acts rather late in monocyte/ macrophage development (16–19). CSF-1R signaling is also important in the brain, being expressed on microglia and possibly neurons, although the latter expression is debated (2, 20–22). The presence of another CSF-1R ligand, IL-34, broadens its biology but also makes interpretation of effects of its blockade more complicated (23, 24). Aside from its role in homeostasis, there is supportive evidence that CSF-1/CSF-1R signaling is important in pathology (2, 12), for example, in models of arthritis (25–29), neurodegeneration (20), diabetes (30), multiple sclerosis (31), Alzheimer disease (32), systemic lupus erythematosus (33), and cancer (2). Clinical trials targeting CSF-1R or CSF-1 in inﬂammatory diseases and cancer are ongoing (2). Due in part to its prosurvival and/or mi- togenic activity on macrophages, CSF-1 is one of the cytokines, along with, for example, GM-CSF and TNF, implicated in pro- moting accumulation of macrophages in the RA synovium (3, 34). High CSF-1 levels have been noted in the RA synovium (35), and anti–CSF-1R mAb can reduce inﬂammatory mediator production in RA synovial explant cultures (29). Studies using animal models of RA have indicated the involvement of CSF-1 and its receptor (25–29) in disease pathogenesis, perhaps by enhancing the ac- cumulation of synovial macrophages, as well as by inducing osteoclastogenesis and bone destruction (3). As regards involvement of CSF-1R/CSF-1 in pain development, a central role has been indicated in regulating neuropathic pain following peripheral nerve injury (36). A study by Thompson et al. (37), based on ﬁndings with an oral CSF-1R inhibitor, suggested a role for CSF-1/CSF-1R signaling in bone cancer pain, which could be largely driven by components of inﬂammatory and neuropathic pain, as well as by osteoclasts causing bone remodeling and resorption (38). Although an inﬂammatory role for CSF-1/CSF-1R signaling has been well established in arthritis models (25–29), its potential involvement in arthritic pain has received limited attention. *Department of Medicine, Royal Melbourne Hospital, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria 3050, Australia; †Inﬂammation Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria 3052, Australia; and ‡Department of Immunology and Environment, Life and Medical Sciences Institute, University of Bonn, 53115 Bonn, Germany 1Current address: Department of Surgery, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL. 2A.D.C. and J.A.H. are joint senior authors.

Using zymosan-induced inﬂammatory and arthritic models, which we have shown to be CCL17, GM-CSF, and TNF dependent (39, 40), and models driven by GM-CSF and TNF, which we have shown to mediate both inﬂammatory and arthritic pain and disease via CCL17 (39, 40), we report for the ﬁrst time, to our knowledge, that systemic mAb neutralization of CSF-1R and/or CSF-1 can prevent, but not ameliorate, the development such pain and disease and can do so with timing similar to that of the clinically important TNF (41). We also show for the ﬁrst time, to our knowledge, that systemic administration of CSF-1 can induce pain and, in addition, can drive inﬂammatory arthritis pain and disease in an inﬂamed joint by a mechanism different from that employed by exogenous GM-CSF and TNF. Materials and Methods Mice C57BL/6 mice were originally from The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute (Kew, VIC, Australia). Transgenic mice were obtained as follows: RAG- 1–deﬁcient (Rag12/2) mice (42) and IFN regulatory factor-4–deﬁcient (Irf42/2) mice (43) were from The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute and homozygous CCL17 mutant (Ccl17E/E) mice, which have both CCL17 alleles replaced with enhanced GFP) (44), were from Prof. I. Fo¨rster (University of Bonn, Germany). Transgenic mice were all backcrossed onto the C57BL/6 background for at least 11 generations. Mice of both sexes (8–12 wk) were used. All experiments were performed in accordance with the ethics approval obtained from The University of Melbourne Animal Ethics Committee. Inﬂammatory pain models Inﬂammatory pain was induced by a single intraplantar (i.pl.; 10 ml) in- jection of zymosan (100 mg; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), GM-CSF (20 ng; PeproTech, NJ), TNF (20 ng; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), or CSF-1 (6.65 mg; Chiron) into the left hind paw, whereas the contra- lateral hind paw received PBS (39); pain was monitored at 2, 4, and 6 h post i.pl. injection as before (39). Zymosan-induced arthritis model Arthritis was induced by an intraarticular (i.a.) injection of zymosan (300 mg; Sigma-Aldrich) in 10 ml of saline into the left joint, whereas the contralateral joint received 10 ml of saline as a control (39). Pain was monitored over a 7-d period using the validated incapacitance method as was done previously (39, 45–47) (see below). On day 7, mice were sac- riﬁced, and knee joints were collected for histological analysis and/or cell population analysis using ﬂow cytometry (FACS). Ag-induced arthritis model As before, mice were immunized with methylated BSA (mBSA) (Sigma- Aldrich), emulsiﬁed in CFA, intradermally in the base of the tail (39, 46, 48). Seven days later (day 0), arthritis was induced by an i.a. injection of mBSA into the left knee and saline into the right knee. Pain was monitored over a 3-d period. mBSA-induced arthritis models mBSA/cytokine arthritis models were induced as before (39, 45, 49) by an i.a. injection of mBSA (200 mg in 0.9% saline) into the left knee and 0.9% saline into the right knee on day 0, followed by s.c. injection of saline (negative control), murine TNF (500 ng; R&D Systems), murine GM-CSF (500 ng; PeproTech), murine IL-1b (250 ng; R&D Systems), or human CSF-1 (6.65 mg; Chiron) on days 0–2. Mice were sacriﬁced on day 2, 4, or 7 post–mBSA injection to collect knee joints for histology or cell pop- ulation analysis. Treatment with mAb or indomethacin Mice were treated i.p. with 200 ml of anti-murine CSF-1 mAb (150 mg) (18) or its humanized IgG1 isotype control (150 mg) (MorphoSys, Planegg, Germany); anti-murine CSF-1R mAb (250 mg, AFS98; Dr. S. I. Nishikawa, Kobe, Japan) (18), anti-murine GM-CSF mAb (150 mg, 22E9.11) (50), anti-Ly6G mAb (150 mg) (46), or their IgG2a isotype control (250 mg); or anti–G-CSFR (150 mg, 5E2-VR81; CSL) (46), anti- murine TNF mAb (150 mg, XT-22) (40), or their IgG1 isotype con- trol (150 mg) (Schering-Plough BioPharma, Palo Alto, CA) at various times as indicated for the different models (see Results section). In some experiments, anti–CSF-1R mAb and its IgG2a isotype control were given i.pl. (2 mg) at the same time as the indicated stimulus (see Results section). Mice were treated i.p. with the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor indomethacin (1 mg/kg; Sigma-Aldrich) daily once pain was evident; pain was measured 1 h posttreatment (39, 45). Pain measurements As a measure of pain, the differential distribution of weight over a 3-s period between the inﬂamed paw or limb relative to the noninﬂamed paw or limb was measured using an incapacitance meter (IITC Life Science, Woodland Hills, CA) as before (39, 45–47). Mice were acclimatized to the incapacitance meter on at least three occasions prior to the com- mencement of the experiment. Three measurements were taken for each time point and averaged. Histology At termination, knee joints were collected, ﬁxed, decalciﬁed, and parafﬁn- embedded (45, 46, 48). Frontal sections (7 mm thick) were stained with H&E. For zymosan-induced arthritis (ZIA), cell inﬁltration, synovial hy- perplasia, bone erosion, and proteoglycan loss (Safranin O/Fast green stain) were scored separately from 0 (normal) to 3 (severe) (39). For the mBSA/cytokine-induced arthritis models, histopathologic features, in- cluding cell inﬁltration, synovitis, pannus formation, cartilage damage, and bone erosion, were scored using an established scoring system ranging from 0 (normal) to 5 (severe), as previously described (39, 45, 49). The sum of these ﬁve features is presented as the total histologic score. Flow cytometry Synovial tissue cells were isolated from knee joints and analyzed by ﬂow cytometry as before (46, 48, 51). Brieﬂy, isolated cells from joint tis- sue were incubated with normal mouse serum (1:4 dilution) and stain- ed using the following Abs: PerCP-conjugated CD45 (clone 30-F11), allophycocyanin-conjugated CD11b (M1/70) and V500-conjugated I-A/I-E (M5/114.15.2) (BD Biosciences), allophycocyanin-Cy7–conjugated Ly6G (1A8) and PE-Cy7–conjugated CD11c (N418) (BioLegend), PE-conjugated F4/80 (BM8) (Life Technologies), and the corresponding isotype controls. Cells were analyzed using a CyAn ﬂow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). Compensation was acquired using single-stained samples, and analysis was performed using Kaluza 1.2 software (Beck- man Coulter). Quantitative PCR Quantitative PCR experiments were performed as described previously (39, 40). Brieﬂy, total RNA was extracted from footpad skin or joint cells using an Isolate II RNA Mini Kit (Bioline) and revere transcribed using Tetro reverse transcriptase (Bioline). Quantitative PCR was performed using an ABI 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) and predeveloped TaqMan probe/primer combinations for murine Ccl17, GMCSF, Tnf, and ubiquitin C (Ubc) (Life Technologies). All samples were assayed in duplicate. Threshold cycle numbers were transformed to Δ threshold cycle values, and the results were expressed relative to the reference gene, Ubc. Statistical analysis For pain measurements, two-way ANOVA compared the differences among three or more groups. For FACS analysis, statistical signiﬁcance was de- termined using a two-tailed Student t test. For histologic scores, a two-way or Kruskal–Wallis one-way ANOVA was used to compare the differences. For gene expression, a two-tailed Student t test was used. GraphPad PRISM software package (La Jolla, CA) was employed to perform these statistical tests. A Bonferroni post hoc test was applied when appropriate. Data are expressed as the mean 6 SEM with signiﬁcance as indicated. A p value #0.05 was considered signiﬁcant. Results CSF-1 is required for the development of zymosan-induced inﬂammatory pain and of ZIA pain and optimal disease i.pl. zymosan administration is a well-studied inﬂammation and pain model (39, 40, 46, 52, 53). CSF-1 involvement in this The Journal of Immunology 2043 Downloaded from http://www.jimmunol.org/ by guest on October 11, 2018 inﬂammatory pain model was examined using neutralizing anti–CSF-1R (AFS98) and anti–CSF-1 mAbs (i.p., days 22 and 21) (18, 48). At 4 and 6 h post i.pl. zymosan injection, pain was evident in mice pretreated with isotype controls but not in those treated with anti–CSF-1R mAb or anti–CSF-1 mAb (Fig. 1A), indicating a CSF-1 dependence. As some indication of the mechanism govern- ing the CSF-1R signaling dependence, and consistent with the dependence of this model on CCL17, GM-CSF, and TNF (39, 40), the mRNA expression levels of these cytokines at 6 h post i.pl. zymosan injection were lower in anti–CSF-1R mAb–treated mice compared with isotype-treated mice (Fig. 1B). ZIA, initiated upon i.a. zymosan, is a widely used macrophage- dependent (54) monoarticular arthritis model. To determine whether CSF-1 is also required for ZIA pain and disease development, the neutralizing anti–CSF-1R and anti–CSF-1 mAbs were again used. Mice were treated with the mAbs on days 22, 0, and 3 to ensure sufﬁcient coverage, with arthritis being induced on day 0. On day 1 following ZIA induction, mice treated with isotype controls showed pain, which was evident until day 4, but mice treated with anti–CSF-1R or anti–CSF-1 mAb (Fig. 2A) did not, again indicating a CSF-1 dependence. Data for TNF involve- ment, using an anti-TNF mAb and its isotype control, are in- cluded by way of comparison (Fig. 2A). Histologically, mice treated with anti–CSF-1R or anti–CSF-1 mAb showed signiﬁ- cantly less arthritis (monitored by cell inﬁltration), synovial hyperplasia, proteoglycan loss (as determined by the amount of red staining in the cartilage by the Safranin O/Fast green stain), and bone erosion (39) than mice treated with their respective isotype controls (Fig. 2B). We also determined the effect of anti–CSF-1R mAb and anti– CSF-1 mAb blockade on the inﬁltrating leukocyte numbers in the ZIA synovium using ﬂow cytometry. Notwithstanding the chal- lenges faced in deﬁning categorically mononuclear phagocyte system populations by surface marker expression (18, 55), we identiﬁed the different synovial myeloid populations, using a gating strategy similar to that previously published (46, 48), and deﬁned them as follows: leukocytes (CD45+), neutrophils (CD11b+Ly6G+), and macrophages (CD11b+F4/80+MHCII+/2). All of these populations were reduced in number upon anti– CSF-1R or anti–CSF-1 treatment (Fig. 2C). Again, regarding the mechanism and consistent with ZIA de- pendence on CCL17, GM-CSF, and TNF (39, 40), in ZIA joints, the mRNA expression levels of these cytokines were signiﬁcantly lower in anti–CSF-1R mAb–treated mice compared with isotype- treated mice (Fig. 2D), similar to those seen in the footpad fol- lowing i.pl. zymosan. To gain more insight into how and when endogenous CSF-1 is acting, we also determined whether the blockade of CSF-1R or CSF-1 had an effect on ZIA pain or dis- ease once initiated. Interestingly, such neutralization of CSF-1R or CSF-1 (i.p. mAb on days 1, 3, and 5) did not ameliorate ZIA pain (Supplemental Fig. 1A) or disease (Supplemental Fig. 1B). Sim- ilar pain data for such TNF blockade are again included as a comparison (Supplemental Fig. 1A). In contrast to ZIA, we previously reported that, unlike anti– GM-CSF or anti–GM-CSFRa mAb blockade, neither anti–CSF- 1R mAb nor anti–CSF-1 mAb blockade prevented Ag-induced arthritis (AIA) development as measured by histology (48). We therefore checked whether the same applied for AIA pain. AIA mice were treated (days 22 and 0) with anti–CSF-1R mAb, anti– CSF-1 mAb, or isotype controls with no effect on pain devel- opment in this T lymphocyte–dependent model (Supplemental Fig. 2A); delayed neutralization of CSF-1R or CSF-1 (i.p., days 2 and 4) also did not ameliorate AIA pain (data not shown) or disease (histology on day 7) (48). In another T lymphocyte– and GM-CSF–dependent monoarticular arthritis model, the so-called mBSA/IL-1 model (i.a. mBSA day 0, s.c. IL-1b days 0–2) (56, 57), we found previously that neither anti–CSF-1R mAb nor anti–CSF-1 mAb reduced arthritis severity (57). We therefore tested whether CSF-1 activity was required for pain induction in this model. As for the AIA model, the degree of pain developed by mBSA/IL-1 mice treated (days 22 and 0) with anti–CSF-1R mAb FIGURE 1. CSF-1 is required for the development of zymosan-induced inﬂammatory pain. (A and B) C57BL/6 mice received an i.pl. injection of zymosan (day 0) and injected i.p. with anti–CSF-1R mAb (250 mg), anti– CSF-1 mAb (150 mg), or isotype control (IgG2a and human/mouse IgG2a, respectively) on days 22 and 21. (A) Pain (incapacitance meter [ratio of weight bearing on injected relative to noninjected hindlimb]; a value ,100 in- dicates pain) and (B) footpad mRNA expression (6 h) were measured (n = 5–10 mice per group).

Collectively, these data indicate that CSF-1, like TNF, is required for the development of zymosan-induced inﬂammatory pain and for ZIA pain and optimal disease, and blockade of CSF-1 signaling results in lower Ccl17, GMCSF, and Tnf mRNA expression at the inﬂammatory site. In contrast, CSF-1 is not required for the de- velopment of AIA and mBSA/IL-1 pain and disease. CSF-1R signaling is required for the development of GM-CSF– induced inﬂammatory pain and of GM-CSF–driven arthritis pain and disease i.pl. GM-CSF also induces acute inﬂammatory pain in a TNF- and CCL17-dependent manner (39, 40). Anti–CSF-1R mAb treatment (days 22 and 21) prevented GM-CSF–induced pain development (Fig. 3A). Upon blockade of CSF-1R signaling, the increased Ccl17 and Tnf mRNA expression was reduced at 6 h (data not shown). We have established a GM-CSF–driven, lymphocyte-independent, monoarticular arthritis model (i.a. mBSA day 0, s.c. GM-CSF days 0–2), thereby potentially enabling downstream mediators of GM-CSF action to be deﬁned (39, 40); we have reported that pain and disease in this model are TNF and CCL17 dependent (39, 40). We used this model to determine whether CSF-1R signaling was required for GM-CSF–driven pain and disease development. Treatment [days 22 and 0, as before (40)] of mBSA/GM-CSF mice with anti–CSF-1R mAb prevented the development of pain seen in isotype-treated mice (Fig. 3B) as well as the development of optimal disease (Fig. 3C). Once again, Ccl17 and Tnf mRNA expression were reduced in mBSA/GM-CSF joints from mice treated with anti–CSF-1R mAb compared with isotype control (Fig. 3D). Delayed blockade of CSF-1R (day 2) again did not FIGURE 2. CSF-1 is required for the development of ZIA pain and optimal disease. (A–D) C57BL/6 mice received an i.a. injection of zymosan and injected i.p. with anti–CSF-1R mAb (250 mg), anti–CSF-1 mAb (150 mg), or isotype control (IgG2a and human/mouse IgG2a, respectively) on days 22, 0, and 3, and (A) pain (incapacitance meter); (B) arthritis (histology: H&E stain [upper], Safranin O/Fast green stain [lower], day 7); (C) synovial cell composition (FACS analysis) for total cells (CD45+), neutrophils (CD11b+Ly6G+), and macrophage subsets (F4/80+MHCII2/+); and (D) joint mRNA expression (day 7) were measured (n = 5–10 mice/group). Mice were also treated i.p. with anti-TNF mAb (150 mg) or IgG1 isotype control and pain was measured (A). For histology images, original magniﬁcation 3125. Results are expressed as mean 6 SEM. The p values were obtained by a two-way ANOVA for pain, a one-way ANOVA for histology and joint cell counts, and a Student t test for gene expression. *p , 0.05, **p, 0.01, ***p , 0.001, ****p , 0.0001, IgG2a isotype versus anti–CSF-1R mAb. #p , 0.05, ##p , 0.01, ###p , 0.001, ####p , 0.0001, h/m IgG2a isotype versus anti–CSF-1 mAb. zp , 0.05, zzp , 0.01, IgG1 isotype versus anti-TNF mAb. The Journal of Immunology 2045 Downloaded from http://www.jimmunol.org/ by guest on October 11, 2018 reverse the pain (Supplemental Fig. 3A) or ameliorate the arthritis (Supplemental Fig. 3B). Thus, similar to zymosan-induced inﬂammatory pain and ZIA and like TNF, CSF-1R signaling is required for the development of GM-CSF–induced inﬂammatory pain and of GM-CSF–driven ar- thritic pain and disease. CSF-1R signaling is required for the development of TNF- induced inﬂammatory pain and of TNF-driven arthritis pain and disease There are several reports demonstrating that i.pl. TNF induces in- ﬂammatory pain (58–61), and we have recently found this pain to be GM-CSF and CCL17 dependent (40). CSF-1R neutralization also prevented i.pl. TNF-induced inﬂammatory pain development (Fig. 4A). Upon blockade of CSF-1R signaling, the increased Ccl17 and GMCSF mRNA expression (6 h) was reduced (data not shown). We have also established a TNF-driven, lymphocyte-independent, monoarticular arthritis model (i.a. mBSA day 0, s.c. TNF days 0–2), likewise enabling mediators downstream of TNF to be po- tentially deﬁned (40); we have found this model to be GM-CSF and CCL17 dependent (40). As for the mBSA/GM-CSF model, pain was not evident (Fig. 4B) and arthritis did not progress (Fig. 4C) following anti–CSF-1R mAb administration (days 22 and 0); delayed CSF-1R blockade (day 2) was again ineffective (Supplemental Fig. 3C, 3D). Thus, similar to GM-CSF–induced inﬂammatory pain and the mBSA/GM-CSF arthritis model, CSF-1R signaling is required for the development of TNF-induced inﬂammatory pain and of TNF-driven arthritis pain and disease. CSF-1 induces inﬂammatory pain and drives arthritic pain and disease The i.pl. injection of CSF-1 itself was sufﬁcient to induce in- ﬂammatory pain within 4 h (Fig. 5A). Similar to the mBSA/IL-1 (49, 62), mBSA/GM-CSF (39, 45), and mBSA/TNF (40) arthritis models, CSF-1 has also been shown to exacerbate the mild synovitis seen following i.a. mBSA, with the degree of synovitis peaking on day 7 before resolving by day 21 (49); arthritic pain, however, was not assessed in that study. Mice injected with mBSA/CSF-1 (i.a. mBSA day 0, s.c. CSF- 1 d 0–2) displayed signiﬁcant pain from 6 h until day 4 (Fig. 5B) [i.e., with rapid kinetics similar to that observed in the mBSA/ TNF arthritis model (Fig. 4B)]. Arthritis severity was increased over days 2–7 compared with mBSA/saline mice and then de- clined (Fig. 5C). We also examined the mechanistic requirements of such CSF- 1–driven arthritis pain and disease. Cell populations. Regarding synovial cell populations, FACS analysis at days 2, 4, and 7 indicated that in the mBSA-injected joint, s.c. CSF-1, compared with s.c. saline, increased total leukocyte (CD45+), neutrophil (CD11b+Ly6G+), and macro- phage (predominantly CD11b+Ly6G2F4/80+MHCII2CD11c2) numbers, which were maximal at day 2 (data not shown). As for the mBSA/GM-CSF (39) and mBSA/TNF (40) models, mBSA/CSF-1 pain and disease were independent of T and B lymphocytes because they were similar in wild type (WT) and Rag12/2 mice (Fig. 6A, 6B, respectively). Even though synovial neutrophil numbers also increased, their FIGURE 3.

G-CSF is a key cytokine for the regulation of neutrophil development, activation, and trafﬁck- ing, particularly during an inﬂammatory reaction (2, 12); neutralizing anti–G-CSFR mAb (46) in the mBSA/CSF-1 ar- thritis model also failed to alter pain and disease, indicating independence from G-CSF signaling (Supplemental Fig. 4F, 4G, respectively). COX activity. The pain in the mBSA/GM-CSF and mBSA/TNF models required COX activity, indicating eicosanoid dependence (40, 45); however, as seen in Fig. 6C and 6D, respectively, both mBSA/CSF-1 pain and disease were not altered by the COX in- hibitor indomethacin.

However, CCL17 is not required in the mBSA/CSF-1 model because pain and disease were similar in gene-deﬁcient (Ccl17E/E) mice to those observed in WT mice (Fig. 6E, 6F, respectively). Surprisingly, given this and our prior data (39, 40), mice treated with anti–GM-CSF mAb or anti-TNF mAb (days 22 and 0) did not develop mBSA/CSF-1 arthritis pain (Fig. 7A, 7C, respectively) or disease (Fig. 7B, 7D, respectively).

Discussion We found above that i.p. CSF-1R/CSF-1 blockade suppressed the onset of pain and disease in three arthritis models driven, re- spectively, by zymosan, GM-CSF, and TNF as well as the pain FIGURE 7. mBSA/CSF-1–driven arthritis pain and disease are dependent on GM-CSF and TNF but independent of IRF4.

The Journal of Immunology 2049 Downloaded from http://www.jimmunol.org/ by guest on October 11, 2018 initiated by i.pl. injection of these stimuli, indicating a CSF-1 requirement. This is the ﬁrst report, to our knowledge, showing that neutralization of CSF-1R or CSF-1 systemically can alleviate pain, indicating a peripheral action for CSF-1. Supporting this peripheral site of action, we also report for the ﬁrst time, to our knowledge, that systemically administered CSF-1 could induce arthritic and inﬂammatory pain. In the arthritis models, as for TNF neutralization, the blockade with the neutralizing mAbs was only effective if they were administered early with respect to the stimulus. Our neutralizing mAb approach is a continuation of the one adopted previously by us in studies comparing the roles of CSF-1 and GM-CSF in homeostasis and pathology (2, 12, 18, 48, 49). Many studies have used oral antagonists of CSF-1R (c-Fms; CD115) kinase activity but run the risk of nonspeciﬁcity, as has been discussed (2). We again compared the effects of anti– CSF-1R and anti–CSF-1 mAbs because the existence of another CSF-1R ligand, namely IL-34, clouds interpretation of approaches targeting only the receptor (23, 24). We recently found (39) that GM-CSF–induced inﬂammatory pain and GM-CSF–driven arthritis pain and disease (mBSA/GM- CSF model) require IRF4 and CCL17. We now show that the proinﬂammatory action of GM-CSF in these models requires CSF-1 as an intermediary. Despite the fact that TNF is a key cytokine in many human inﬂammatory disorders, its mode of action in these conditions is still unknown. As for the GM- CSF–driven regulation, we provided evidence above that CSF-1 can also play a part in exogenous TNF regulation of pain and arthritis. Thus, CSF-1 can play a critical role in the pain and ar- thritic disease elicited by two cytokines that are pivotal to RA pathogenesis (2, 63). As regards the possible mechanism(s) for the effectiveness of early CSF-1R blockade in the joint, reduced sy- novial myeloid cell numbers were noted in ZIA, along with a reduction in expression of Tnf, GMCSF, and Ccl17 mRNA at the site of inﬂammation consistent with the requirement for these cytokines in this model (39, 40). It may be that CSF-1 is needed only when joint tissue levels of TNF or GM-CSF are sufﬁcient; such levels could ﬂuctuate even during progression of a chronic disease (e.g., during an RA “ﬂare”). We have recently found that there is a requirement for GM-CSF in the same exogenous TNF- driven model (40), again indicating a link between the activities of the two CSFs in question. It has been proposed that the successful treatment of the TNF transgenic mouse arthritis model with a TNF inhibitor was due to decreased migration of monocytes and/or increased synovial macrophage apoptosis (64); based on our ﬁnding, perhaps CSF-1 could be involved in regulating these functions. Also, and encouragingly for any clinical applications arising from our above ﬁndings, the beneﬁt of early but not late CSF-1 blockade parallels that of anti-TNF blockade for ZIA (Fig. 2) (40) and mBSA/GM-CSF models (Fig. 3) (40), given that TNF blockade is quite successful in many human inﬂammatory conditions (63). Consistent with this similarity, both anti-TNF mAb (65, 66) and anti–CSF-1R mAb blockade (29) reduce in- ﬂammatory mediator production in RA synovial explant cultures. Systemic administration of CSF-1 can exacerbate collagen- induced arthritis (25) and a monoarticular mBSA-primed arthri- tis model (49). We have taken advantage of the latter model by showing that pain is induced rapidly. Regarding mechanism, and even though the effects of systemic administration of a ligand may not necessarily be informative about its endogenous role (2, 12), increased myeloid cell inﬁltration and local macrophage prolif- eration (49) were observed in the mBSA-injected joint in the mBSA/CSF-1 model, consistent with our proposal above on the role of endogenous CSF-1 in increasing myeloid cell numbers in inﬂammatory arthritis, as well as previously in certain other inﬂammatory reactions (2, 3, 18). Lymphocytes, neutrophils, and G-CSFR signaling appear not to be involved in this CSF-1–driven arthritis model. For neutrophils, at least, this was found to be in contrast to both GM-CSF– and TNF-driven arthritis pain and disease (46). In accord with the inability of CSF-1 to induce PGE2 in murine macrophages (67) and human monocytes (68), pain and arthritis in the mBSA/CSF-1 model, again unlike the pain in the mBSA/GM-CSF and mBSA/TNF models (39, 40), were not modiﬁed by COX inhibition indicating a lack of eicosanoid in- volvement. Interestingly, despite synovial tissue Ccl17 mRNA expression being increased in the mBSA/CSF-1 model (data not shown) in a similar fashion to the zymosan-, GM-CSF–, and TNF- driven models (39, 40), there was no requirement for CCL17 or IRF4. Given we have previously shown that CSF-1 is unable to upregulate CCL17 or IRF4 in monocytes/macrophages (39, 69, 70), this suggests that both the increased tissue Ccl17 mRNA expression in the mBSA/CSF-1 model and the decreased tissue Ccl17 mRNA expression seen following CSF-1R blockade in the zymosan-, GM-CSF–, and TNF-driven models are not direct. In- triguingly, however, there was a requirement for GM-CSF and TNF in the mBSA/CSF-1 model. Although this may explain the increased Ccl17 expression (i.e., via GM-CSF), it does not explain why CCL17 is not required; the reason for this is currently being investigated. Although the TNF-driven (mBSA/TNF) and the CSF-1-driven (mBSA/CSF-1) arthritis models seem to function via different pathways, TNF and CSF-1 interact with the mBSA-injected joint with the same rapid kinetics. How systemically administered CSF-1 upregulates the pain and arthritis in the mBSA-“primed” (inﬂamed) joint, presumably by acting on a monocyte/macrophage population(s) (2, 12, 15, 24), and with a GM-CSF and TNF re- quirement, remains to be elucidated. It has been proposed that CSF-1 could be used as a therapeutic agent in tissue repair (15); the pain induction in the mBSA/CSF-1 model and the arthritis progression in this and in other arthritis models (25, 49) indicate that such therapeutic applications should proceed with caution. We have previously invoked CSF-1, GM-CSF, and TNF as being part of an inﬂammatory cytokine “network” with possible impli- cations for regulating macrophage numbers and function at a site of chronic inﬂammation: for example, the RA synovium (3, 12, 34). From the above, these concepts can be extended to include the regulation of inﬂammatory pain. Our data conﬁrm that even though CSF-1 and GM-CSF are both prosurvival/mitogenic fac- tors for monocytes/macrophages (2, 3, 12, 18, 34) and, as men- tioned, their activities can be linked, they have very different functions overall (2, 3, 12, 18, 69, 71). How might endogenous CSF-1 be regulating pain and arthritis peripherally and when is it likely to be important in this context? Emerging roles for CSF-1R and its ligands in the nervous system have recently been reported (2, 20–22). There is disagreement as to whether there is CSF-1R expression in the neuronal lineage, with developmental control probably being important (2, 19–22). CSF-1 has been proposed to act centrally on microglia to control nerve injury–induced neuropathic pain and to therefore be a target in this condition (36, 72). In lupus-prone mice, the development of chronic pain is associated with the activation of microglia and overexpression of CSF-1 in the spinal cord (73). Our i.p. mAb blockade data above suggest that CSF-1 can also act peripherally to regulate pain, probably by its action on macrophages in tissues and possibly in nerves (74). In this connection, local i.a. CSF-1R blockade–reduced joint swelling and pain are consistent with peripheral ligand activity (75), and important cross-talk between CSF-1–activated muscularis macrophages and enteric neurons has been identiﬁed (2, 76). 2050 CSF-1 IN INFLAMMATORY AND ARTHRITIC PAIN DEVELOPMENT Downloaded from http://www.jimmunol.org/ by guest on October 11, 2018 The three arthritis models studied above in which early CSF-1R blockade was effective are lymphocyte independent, whereas other monoarticular models in which no effect on pain or arthritis was observed, namely the AIA and mBSA/IL-1 models, are T lymphocyte dependent (48, 56), suggesting a possible expla- nation. However, mAb-mediated CSF-1R or CSF-1 blockade is effective in the systemic, T lymphocyte–dependent collagen- induced arthritis model, although there is debate as to in what stage CSF-1 might be acting (25–27, 29). Our ﬁndings above on early blockade appear similar to those showing that the anti– CSF-1R mAb (AFS98) used above prevents the initial events of atherogenesis but does not reduce the size of advanced lesions in apolipoprotein E–deﬁcient mice (77). There is evidence that CSF-1 acts rather late in the development of the monocyte/ macrophage lineage, with a key activity likely being on regulat- ing the numbers of resident tissue macrophages and more mature blood monocytes rather than less mature “inﬂammatory” mono- cytes (2, 16–18). We have proposed as a possible mechanism that at a site of inﬂammation, CSF-1 neutralization depletes resident tissue macrophages, thereby governing overall myeloid and lym- phoid cell inﬁltration (3, 18), a proposal consistent with our ﬁndings in the ZIA model and the suggested role of phagocytosis of zymosan by such macrophages in inﬂammation (78, 79); a similar mechanism may also apply to the poorly soluble mBSA (80–82) in the joint. In this connection, depletion of resident pancreatic islet macrophages by the AFS98 mAb reduced diabetes in the NOD mouse (30) and suppressed diabetic nephropathy in db/db mice by targeting macrophage-mediated injury (83). Our concept invoking the signiﬁcance of CSF-1 action on resident tissue macrophage numbers and/or function (3, 18) offers an ex- planation for the efﬁcacy of early CSF-1R/CSF-1 blockade, and our ﬁndings above clarify how and when CSF-1 might function as a critical proinﬂammatory mediator. Our ﬁndings above have important ramiﬁcations for the clinical trials in inﬂammatory diseases mainly targeting CSF-1R with oral antagonists and that so far are not particularly encouraging (2). It could be that CSF-1 is only relevant in patients with conditions in which the driving inﬂammatory insults in tissues are acute and/or periodic and involve resident tissue macrophages. Moreover, our ﬁndings also suggest that CSF-1 can be targeted peripherally with an mAb strategy to control pain and can be critical to the patho- genic roles of the clinically important cytokines, TNF and GM- CSF (2, 41, 84). These ideas, based in part on our current ﬁndings, perhaps could be incorporated into the selection and design of future anti–CSF-1R/CSF-1 clinical trials.

This committed community of stakeholders has made major strides to improve patient care, but also recognizes multiple aspects of the clinical research sys- tem that need to be improved or reimagined. FACTORS ADVERSELY AFFECTING HF CLINICAL TRIALS Although randomized controlled trials are the gold standard for clinical evidence gen- eration, they have become slow, cumber- some, and costly, and often have limited generalizability. There appears to be a myriad of causes. 1. PATIENT ENGAGEMENT. Poor patient enrollment leads to slow and costly clinical trials (2). A number of factors inﬂuence patients’ decisions to participate in clinical research, including trial complexity and burden, a favorable beneﬁt to risk proﬁle for the experimental treatment, and the potential to help others (3). However, patient input has rarely been utilized to improve these issues, and patients may struggle to ﬁnd accessible information regarding clinical trials, support from members of the HF com- munity with similar phenotypes, and time for dis- cussion about clinical research during clinic visits. 2. CULTURE OF PARTICIPATION. Few clinicians participate as investigators in HF clinical trials, in part because of poor incentivization. In an online survey of 200 U.S. principal investigators, over one-half declared their intention to leave the inves- tigator workforce (4). Commonly identiﬁed impedi- ments and disincentives include lack of opportunity, burden from other obligations, required time and trial bureaucracy, difﬁculty navigating onerous eligibility criteria, lack of institutional support, country-speciﬁc legal requirements, and lack of ﬁnancial or profes- sional compensation. Clinical trial sites must support large direct and indirect costs associated with administering clinical trials, including adhering to regulatory requirements; mitigating potential risk; and constructing, training, and maintaining the site apparatus (5). 3. EVIDENCE GENERATION. HF clinical trials typi- cally require large sample sizes and prolonged follow- up to demonstrate safety and efﬁcacy; in contrast, a new therapeutic agent for orphan diseases or cancer subtypes, where no prior effective therapy may exist, may achieve a large and meaningful treatment effect (6,7). Incorporation of patient- reported outcomes (PROs) and other alternative endpoints has been slow. Inclusion and exclusion criteria intended to select a subpopulation most likely to respond to the intervention (predictive enrich- ment) and most likely to experience events of interest (prognostic enrichment) may delay enrollment and extend a trial (8). The brisk globalization of clinical trials leads to enrollment of fewer American patients and under-representation of American practice patterns, further impairing generalizability (9). 4. DESIGN. From 2000 to 2007, the number of eligi- bility criteria and procedures required for trial pro- tocols across multiple therapeutic areas rose 50% while volunteer enrollment and retention fell 20% to 30% (10). Local institutional review boards (IRBs) request changes to protocols and consents over 90% of the time, often with multiple changes per study site (11). Broad data and adverse event reporting has been criticized as a critical element leading to overly complicated trials. Regulators, payers, and sponsors remain unaligned over which adverse events should be captured and reported, despite U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance suggesting that recording fewer events may be acceptable (12). Finally, complex protocols are difﬁcult to incorporate into daily clinical practice, driving a wedge between health care delivery and medical research. 5. COST. Clinical trial costs, particularly for cardio- vascular trials, have risen out of proportion to inﬂa- tion. Total cost per enrolled patient has more than quadrupled between 1989 and 2011, compared with a doubling in expenditures for biomedical research and development (13). Clinical trials accounted for 70% of the $46 billion spent by members of the Pharmaceu- tical Research and Manufacturers of America on research and development in 2010, and industry sponsors fund a substantial proportion of randomized controlled trials published in highly-cited medical journals (14). The total cost to develop a novel ther- apeutic and bring it to market has doubled and is now estimated to exceed $2.5 billion (15). This growth is linked at least in part to expanding trial complexity associated with outsourcing of services to contract research organizations, with a doubling in person- effort required at each trial site to enroll one-half of the patients (1,16). 6. RETURN ON INVESTMENT. Development of a clin- ically effective and commercially viable product is fraught with regulatory and payer uncertainty. Following phase 1 trials, only 29% of drugs for the treatment of rare diseases and 10% of drugs for car- diovascular disease eventually achieve regulatory A B B R E V I A T I O N S A N D A C R O N Y M S CF = cystic ﬁbrosis CFF = Cystic Fibrosis Foundation CRN = Clinical Research Network EHR = electronic health record FDA = U.S. Food and Drug Administration HF = heart failure IRB = institutional review board TDN = Cystic Fibrosis Therapeutics Development Network O’Connor et al.

Even following phase 3 pivotal trials, only 46% become internationally approved, whereas 36% are approved by the FDA (18). Recently, rare successes in new molecular entity development have been greeted by slow physician uptake and prescrib- ing, limiting the ability of sponsors to recoup their ﬁnancial investment (19). Payers tend to prioritize health gains per expenditure and limit their ﬁnancial hazard to the most cost-effective agents, which may not favor novel therapies (20). Payers have also become more restrictive in coverage determinations, requiring increasing evidence prior to approval. To boost their chances, sponsors may seek to collect proactively what might otherwise be considered extraneous data, further ballooning trial cost and complexity. LESSONS LEARNED FROM COLLEAGUES ONCOLOGY. Although the oncology clinical trial environment has faced similar difﬁculties, it is ﬂour- ishing, in part because of systemic reforms drafted by the oncology community in 2010 and the collabora- tive work of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (21). A central accessible trial registry was created to improve clinical research awareness. Patient advocate involvement was encouraged to design engaging trials, assist in patient recruitment, and make research participation a principal compo- nent of clinical practice. Improved reimbursement rates and suitable rewards for academic investigators were recommended, such that clinicians could be paid for their research contributions akin to their clinical work. A monthly conﬁdential global regula- tors’ meeting was established to improve global in- teractions with regulatory bodies. Alternative clinical trial designs were prioritized, including master pro- tocols for each tumor type, molecular target pro- tocols, and use of central IRBs. A “breakthrough” designation for novel agents with the highest poten- tial for clinical success was created, exempliﬁed by the adaptive phase 2 and 3 trials of pembrolizumab for solid tumors; the trials enrolled 1,253 patients from 101 sites over 3 years as part of numerous var- iably timed expansion cohorts, culminating with rapid FDA approval (22). Due in part to these changes and differences in trial design, the oncology pipeline currently boasts the largest number of preclinical therapeutics in development of any ﬁeld (17). Some trends in oncology trials are, however, less applicable to the HF ecosystem (Table 1). Use of sur- rogate endpoints and biomarkers has allowed earlier FIGURE 1 Primary Stakeholders in the U.S. Heart Failure Clinical Trial Ecosystem Regulators Funding/Sponsors Local Review Boards Government Funding Agencies Industry Society & Institutional Funding Contract Research Organizations Patients Investigators Clinical Trial Sites Health Systems Payers Third-Party Payers CMS FDA Lines represent the interconnected interactions between major groups of clinical trial stakeholders, all revolving around patient care improvement.

Nonetheless, large effect size estimates from unvalidated surrogates may disproportionately increase uptake and reasonable payer compensation compared with more modest and clinically relevant results from trials with robust mortality endpoints (23). In 150 cardiovascular trials with positive surro- gate endpoints, only 15% had a subsequent published outcomes trial that validated the earlier results, and some large, appropriately powered outcomes trials of HF and cancer therapeutics have demonstrated harm following promising surrogate endpoint studies (23–26). CYSTIC FIBROSIS. The cystic ﬁbrosis (CF) clinical trial ecosystem was principally constructed by a patient advocacy foundation. Despite a worldwide CF population of only 70,000, CF has had 7 new thera- pies approved in the last 25 years since the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) launched the CF Thera- peutics Development Network (TDN) (27). The CFF developed this strategically aligned research network by coordinating pharmaceutical companies and in- vestigators; the CFF oversees the pharmaceutical evaluation platform. It successfully established uni- form research endpoints, deﬁned standard clinical care, developed appropriate clinical research site assessment strategies, and provided centralized study appraisal and review. Pharmaceutical rights from 2 novel medications approved in 2011 and 2015 have fed over $3 billion in revenue to the CFF, which it reinvested into core research team funding (28). The CFF also oversees accreditation of over 120 U.S. CF clinical care centers that form a large longitudinal patient registry used for phase 4, post-marketing, and epidemiological data collection. This system con- tinues to bear fruit, with diverse novel agents popu- lating various stages of development in 55 ongoing clinical trials at 89 TDN centers. The crown jewel of the CF model is patient empowerment. This was achieved by partnering with advocates and care groups to educate and inform patients of their crucial role in promoting and improving their health through clinical research. The TDN steering committee ensures that preclinical and clinical research decisions focus on safely improving patient lives, which encourages patients to seek out clinical trials as part of an embedded research culture (28). The user-friendly CF clinical trial ﬁnder (29) fa- cilitates patient engagement; patients may browse available trials and patient-accessible inclusion and exclusion criteria, and can use direct links to contact TABLE 1 Barriers to Heart Failure Clinical Trial Success and Potential Solutions Barriers Potential Solutions Suitability for the Heart Failure Environment Patient engagement Onerous informed consent Streamline informed consent with improved communication Widely applicable Lack of information resources Create a central clinical trial information clearinghouse and patient portal Widely applicable Travel costs and logistics Limit study-speciﬁc visits with pragmatic methods Widely applicable with some limitations Culture of participation Incentives Financial and academic rewards for investigator research, including by payers and health systems Feasible for health systems, societies, and industry leadership to prioritize clinical trial activity Complex contracting Standardized contracting protocols and arrangements with clinical trial sites Feasibility actively being investigated Local regulatory (IRB) delays Central IRBs for multisite trials Feasibility actively being investigated Evidence generation Modest treatment effects Pragmatic methodology and novel data collection methods to achieve large sample sizes and follow-up Widely applicable with some limitations Generalizability Identify methods to diversify enrollment during planning, including for populations likely to demonstrate heterogenous treatment effects; limit eligibility requirements (comorbidities); use diverse media outlets and online cohorts Targeted enrollment is feasible in some cases, pragmatic methodology and electronic resources applicable with some limitations Design Complexity and cost Pragmatic and adaptive methodology, with novel data collection methods, as possible Widely applicable with some limitations Return on investment Regulatory and payer uncertainty Coordinate stakeholders (including regulators and payers) throughout therapeutic development Regulators are enthusiastic about early inclusion, the feasibility of including payers remains uncertain IRB ¼ institutional review board.

In the ﬁrst month of the site’s existence, there were over 25,000 page views and 300 direct links between patients and research coordinators. This site also provides participants with their clinical trial results, reinforcing how they have improved future patient care. Actively monitored peer-to-peer forums are provided by the CFF to further distribute comprehensive and accurate infor- mation and build clinical research enthusiasm. SUITABILITY OF THE CF FRAMEWORK FOR THE HF ENVIRONMENT Although the CF model cannot be replicated for HF en bloc, successful features may be transportable (Table 1). A patient-accessible clearinghouse could explain trial rationale, purported mechanisms of ac- tion, and anticipated side effects; be used as a portal to connect patients and enrolling clinical trials’ co- ordinators; and serve as a gateway to improved informed consent. A culture of research must be established, as fostering patient engagement alone will not reform the HF ecosystem. HF research and clinical practice will need to be integrated into a single comprehensive system where participation of physicians and patients will be the norm. The bene- ﬁcial effects of clinical trial participation on adher- ence to guideline-directed therapy and education could, and should, be touted (30). Investigators should be nurtured, acknowledged, and rewarded for their participation and successful target achievement with meaningful ﬁnancial and academic compensa- tion. The CFF mandates that senior principal in- vestigators mentor a junior investigator in every clinical trial, indoctrinating and developing them in a self-perpetuating reinvestment cycle. Payers, in- stitutions, and health systems can reimburse for pa- tient enrollment and the production of high-quality data, and recertiﬁcation could be supported by investigator activity. As most cardiologists have shifted their practice over the last 2 decades to direct employment or close alignment with large health systems, management within these systems has the opportunity to employ creative payment structures that encourage research participation, such as quality incentives linked to bonuses (31). Leadership on the behalf of payers, industry, and societies will be vital. Replicating a disease-speciﬁc clinical research network (CRN) like the CF TDN would be welcomed by HF trial stakeholders. The current National In- stitutes of Health (NIH)–supported Heart Failure Network focuses on smaller studies at a limited number of centers compared with organizations in other therapeutic domains (32,33). A broad-reaching CRN of vetted HF clinical trial sites overseen by a centralized patient-centered organization could nurture young investigators, train and monitor sites and coordinators, establish centralized IRBs, facili- tate contracting, partially mitigate risk, attract in- dustry partners to expand the drug development pipeline, and establish a vast HF registry. Such a CRN could align hundreds of centers to produce coordi- nated and compatible data with consistent adverse event reporting and standardized trial endpoints, deﬁnitions, and standard practices. A CRN could also coordinate stakeholders throughout the therapeutic development process to ensure agreement on neces- sary trial attributes and comparator interventions for regulatory approval and payer coverage. This is particularly crucial with potential alternative and adaptive trial designs that may use novel endpoints such as PROs, highlighted by a recent Medicare Evi- dence Development & Coverage Advisory Committee meeting (34). LESSONS LEARNED FROM GLOBAL EFFORTS International trial communities have proposed inte- gration of trials into clinical practice and medical training, improved analytics, utilization of alterna- tive endpoints that include PROs and worsening HF, and identiﬁcation of reassuring safety margins for mortality and morbidity (7). Employment of a car- diovascular risk assessment model similar to the 2008 FDA guidance for diabetes therapies, in which the upper bound of the 95% conﬁdence interval can be used to determine the need for a large safety trial, may promote novel development plans and the use of patient-centered endpoints (35). Despite these efforts, enrollment rates worldwide remain unac- ceptable, and deﬁciencies in the United States compared with international enrollment suggest that some solutions should be speciﬁc to the region (Table 2). NEW METHODOLOGIES Multiple organizations are working with regulators to establish methods to perform and interpret clinical trials at lower cost and with greater efﬁciency, often by using data from extant registries or administrative databases. Such designs have been termed “pragmatic” because of their scaled-down infra- structure with decreased site monitoring and safety reporting; intention to test real-world effectiveness of interventions in usual care settings with minimal J A C C V O L . 7 1 , N O . 4 , 2 0 1 8 O’Connor et al. J A N U A R Y 3 0 , 2 0 1 8 : 4 4 3 – 5 3 Heart Failure Collaboratory 447 trial-speciﬁc visits, procedures, or exclusion criteria; and focused outcome collection that avoids costly and time-consuming extraneous information. The NIH has partnered with the FDA and the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network to establish multiple demonstration projects that seek to prove the effectiveness and efﬁciency of pragmatic methodology (Table 3). Nevertheless, current iterations of pragmatic trials have limitations (Table 1). Because pragmatic trials accept the heterogeneity of standard clinical care, they must be large enough to appropriately overcome this variability (36). Although blinding of treatment allocation and outcome assessment is not typical of real-world care, important safety events other than major outcomes may be altered by unmasked bias.

New analytic methods need to be adopted to interpret data from these novel schemes, in part because incomplete ascertainment and trial drop out may play a larger role, and it may take time before the research community achieves consensus over how to interpret the results. A broader goal potentiated by the proliferation of electronic health records (EHRs) is creation of a “learning healthcare system” in which medical prac- tice continuously generates clinical research data that itself continuously informs clinical care (37). Unfor- tunately, even though 95% of hospitals and 62% of cardiology practices employ an EHR, this concept has not yet proven functional or reliable, limited by incomplete and incorrectly entered information, erratic and potentially biased coding by providers and assistants, difﬁculty following patients if they tran- sition to a separate medical system or payer plan, and the inherent ambiguity of analog text in clinical notes (37). Although clinical decision support tools and predictive analytics display potential, as well as using the EHR and machine learning to identify subjects for trial enrollment, such as with the Flag, Identify, Network, Deliver Familial Hypercholesterolemia program (38), they will require further development, input of high-quality data, and likely changes in ingrained clinical documentation behaviors. Novel electronic trial organization and data collection technologies may separately improve the efﬁciency of the clinical trial apparatus in an inter- connected electronic society with almost ubiquitous personal smartphone use (Table 1). The MyHeart Counts platform (39) and Eureka (40), an NIH-funded internet-based clinical trial system, are 2 burgeoning research portals that allow scalable clinical trial enrollment and data collection at reduced cost. MyHeart Counts functions through an application from the Apple ResearchKit (41). Participant activity data suggested its potential to assist in rapid trial enrollment, but also demonstrated limitations.

J A N U A R Y 3 0 , 2 0 1 8 : 4 4 3 – 5 3 Heart Failure Collaboratory 449 Almost 50,000 registrants consented to participate over 8 months, with 81% uploading at least some data; however, only 3% submitted complete data. The Eureka platform, powered by Amazon Web Services, has a currently accessible cohort of over 100,000 subjects, including more than 50% women, and its proportionally few minorities can be enriched in subgroups created for trial purposes (42). Utilization of similar systems has been associated with 50% ﬁnancial savings over conventional strategies (43). Novel electronically captured HF clinical trial end- points may characterize disease impact and drug or device treatment effect better than traditional end- points, although validation is needed (44). GENERALIZABILITY AND REPRESENTATIVE POPULATIONS Discordant HF therapeutic responses between de- mographic subgroups are common, including with newly approved pharmaceuticals (45). A review of all new molecular entities approved by the FDA from 2008 to 2013 demonstrated that 21% displayed racial or ethnic differences in pharmacokinetics, safety, or efﬁcacy (46). Nonetheless, HF clinical trials have persistently enrolled a large number of younger white males, creating a misalignment with the racial, ethnic, sex, age, and socioeconomic diversity present in the United States (47,48). Because of these issues, the FDA created freely available drug trial snapshots to highlight the enrollment diversity and generaliz- ability of clinical trials (Figure 2) (49). Unfortunately, imbalances in clinical trial enroll- ment have been stubbornly resistant to recent in- terventions. A statutory mandate to include women and minority groups in federally sponsored trials exists, and published FDA guidance requests reporting of age, race, ethnicity, and sex data, as well as the expectation that trial subjects will be demographically similar to their intended target populations (50,51). Some apparent enrollment disparities may be due to underlying CENTRAL ILLUSTRATION Heart Failure Collaboratory Working Groups and Anticipated Achievements Challenges with HF Clinical Trials Actionable opportunities to improve HF trials HEART FAILURE (HF) CLINICAL TRIALS IN THE UNITED STATES Unappealing to patients Complex; burdensome;  lack information and support Unappealing to investigators  Lack of compensation and support;  time burden; trial bureaucracy;  complex eligibility criteria and legal requirements Complicated and impractical trial design Large sample sizes; prolonged follow up;  stringent eligibility criteria High costs to outsourcing and trial complexity,  limiting the ability of sponsors to recoup their investment Entice patients • Partner with patient groups  (Educate, inform and empower patients) • Implement strategies for diversity Entice Investigators • Improved reimbursement, rewards  and acknowledgments • Make research participation a priority • Integrate trials into clinical practice  • Payers, institutions, and health systems to reimburse for patient enrollment and engaging trials O’Connor, C.M. et al. J Am Coll Cardiol. 2018;71(4):443–53. Difﬁculties conducting HF clinical trials brought together a multidisciplinary stakeholder group focused on improving the design, performance, and utility of future HF research. HF ¼ heart failure.

For instance, HF with reduced ejection fraction tends to be more associated with male sex and HF with preserved ejection fraction with female sex (52,53). Nevertheless, the pivotal outcomes trial of sacubitril-valsartan, the most recent drug approved for HF with reduced ejection fraction, included only 22% women. Only 5% black or African-American subjects out of 8,442 total pa- tients were enrolled, despite an extensive and continuous planned recruitment effort that did sign up 428 African-American patients constituting 26% of the U.S. enrollment (Figure 2) (19). Novel remedies are needed to improve enrollment diversity (Table 1). Investigators and sponsors are now required to detail recruitment strategies for diverse populations in regulatory planning docu- ments. Improved patient engagement and education may increase diversity, as educated participants acknowledge the beneﬁts and value of clinical trial participation (3,54). Minority groups may distrust research because of historical medical exploitation; thus, a diverse research team may help broaden enrollment (55,56). Connections with community leaders and institutions; extending outreach to include clinics in underserved communities, churches, and other cultural centers; and ongoing collaboration with local and national advocacy groups may improve diversity. An established HF CRN could assist in this regard, and prudent use of electronic media or online patient portals such as Patient- sLikeMe (57), which boasts 66% female registrants, may be able to access more diverse user communities (58). Nonetheless, equal enrollment by sex, race, and ethnicity does not ensure generalizability. De- mographic attributes, underlying social and eco- nomic factors, and cultural belief systems can meaningfully affect baseline risk, comorbidities, health outcomes, and responses to therapeutics (59). Comorbidities have been routinely excluded from HF clinical trials, despite evidence that they sub- stantially affect the likelihood of adverse outcomes and are clinically meaningful to patients and pro- viders (60). Analytical schemes to describe and simplify these complex interactions in HF patients have been initiated (61). Multidomain phenotyping of patients has repeatedly identiﬁed combinations of factors that predict adverse outcomes in learning and validation cohorts (60). Unfortunately, the complexity of these interactions currently makes their routine clinical assessment unwieldy, although their use for therapeutic targeting and population comparisons may represent the future for deter- mining personalized risk and beneﬁt. In the mean- time, the FDA and expert trialists agree that banking of genetic samples for later analyses and association studies is crucial if unforeseen hetero- geneity arises following clinical trial conclusion, as genomic data may help to tease out the bases for described differences (51). CONCLUSIONS The current state of HF clinical research is in critical need of attention, with speciﬁc barriers for research in the United States to overcome. The clinical research infrastructures for other disease states suggest some feasible ways in which the HF ecosystem can be reformed. Patient engagement, rejuvenated physician commitment, promotion of a clinical research culture, collaboration among the stakeholders during trial conceptualization and performance, centrally organized and vetted research networks, novel methods of evidence generation and trial recruitment, and a focus on implementation of new therapies may help reverse the deleterious trend threatening cardiovascular therapeutic innovation. Establishment of a func- tional, multifaceted HF clinical trial apparatus will require more than a simple recapitulation of the successes realized by others, and novel methodol- ogies will be needed in addition to active teamwork among community. To achieve success, the ideas expressed here are being used as a launch pad for ongoing endeavors through a multistakeholder effort entitled the “Heart Failure Collaboratory” (Central Illustration). This new effort has established 5 working groups to tackle individual issues with short- and long-term goals for improving the cur- rent environment by producing, distributing, and enacting guidance and recommendations: 1) Elec- tronic or Digital Health; 2) Regulatory Policy and Implementation Science in Drug Development; 3) Regulatory Policy and Implementation Science in Device Development; 4) Research Networks and the Role of Societies; and 5) Representative Pop- ulations. These endeavors will be crucial to rein- vigorating the HF evidence development apparatus, and can provide a framework for other disease states to nurture their own evidence-generation programs.
