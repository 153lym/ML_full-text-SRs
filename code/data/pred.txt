For example, the optimal time to switch antiretroviral therapy depends on the frequency with which HIV-positive individuals have HIV RNA measured. This paper describes an approach to use observational data for the comparison of joint monitoring and treatment strate- gies and applies the method to a clinically relevant question in HIV research: when can monitoring frequency be decreased and when should individuals switch from a first-line treatment regimen to a new regimen? We outline the target trial that would compare the dynamic strategies of inter- est and then describe how to emulate it using data from HIV-positive individuals included in the HIV-CAUSAL Collaboration and the Centers for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems. When, as in our example, few individ- uals follow the dynamic strategies of interest over long periods of follow-up, we describe how to leverage an additional assumption: no direct effect of monitor- ing on the outcome of interest. We compare our results with and without the “no direct effect” assumption. We found little differences on survival and AIDS-free survival between strategies where monitoring frequency was decreased at a CD4 threshold of 350 cells/μl compared with 500 cells/μl and where treat- ment was switched at an HIV-RNA threshold of 1000 copies/ml compared with 200 copies/ml.

For example, some guidelines recommend that adults initiate statin therapy if LDL cholesterol is greater than 190 mg/dL,1 and others recommend that HIV-positive individuals switch treatment (antiretroviral therapy [ART]) if HIV RNA is greater than 500 copies/ml.2 These guidelines are examples of dynamic strategies because the decision to start or switch therapy depends on an individual's time-varying covariates (LDL cholesterol or HIV RNA). When randomized trials are not available to inform guidelines, observational data can be used to try to emulate a hypothetical randomized trial, ie, a target trial,3 of dynamic strategies. For example, previous observational analyses have emulated target trials in which HIV-positive individuals were assigned to different treatment initiation and switching strategies.4-10 Adjustment for measured time-varying confounders was achieved via inverse probability weighting4,6 or the parametric g-formula.8-10 However, recommendations about when to start or switch a therapy generally depend on the frequency with which individuals are monitored or tested.11 For example, the optimal time to switch therapy may be the first time HIV RNA crosses above 500 copies/ml if HIV-positive individuals are monitored every 6 months but at a different threshold, ie, lower than 500 copies/ml, if individuals were monitored every 12 months. Therefore, clinical guidelines for starting or switching a treatment based on the results of a test need to specify both the frequency of monitoring/testing and the threshold at which treatment is started or switched. In this paper, we extend the methodology to emulate a target trial of joint monitoring and treatment strategies using observational data and describe how to leverage an additional assumption: no effect of monitoring on the outcome except through aiding decisions concerning when to switch ART.11 Exploiting this “no direct effect” assumption may drastically decrease the estimates' variance without requiring additional modeling assumptions. Section 2 outlines the key components of the target trial and how to emulate it using observational data from HIV-positive individuals. In Section 3, we describe how to estimate the per-protocol effect, first in the target trial and then using observational data. Section 4 introduces the “no direct effect” assumption and compares the efficiency of the results estimated with and without the additional assumption. 2 SPECIFICATION AND EMULATION OF THE TARGET TRIAL Table 1 summarizes the key components of the protocol of the target trial in which participants are randomly assigned to one of four joint monitoring and treatment strategies, based loosely on current clinical guidelines.2,15-17 The goal of the trial is to determine the joint strategy with the greatest 5-year survival and AIDS-free survival for HIV-positive individuals who achieve virologic suppression within 12 months of initiating an eligible ART regimen. Strategy (1): CD4 threshold 350/tight control. In this strategy, CD4 cell count and HIV RNA are monitored every 3-6 months when CD4 is below a threshold of 350 cells/μl and every 9-12 months when CD4 is above the threshold, and individuals switch treatment within 3 months of HIV RNA crossing above 200 copies/ml (tight control) and do not switch again. Strategy (2): CD4 threshold 350/loose control. This strategy is the same as (1) except that the HIV-RNA threshold is 1000 copies/ml (loose control). Strategy (3): CD4 threshold 500/tight control. This strategy is the same as (1) except that the CD4 cell count threshold is 500 cells/μl. Strategy (4): CD4 threshold 500/loose control. This strategy is the same as (3) except that the HIV-RNA threshold is 1000 copies/ml. All four strategies further require individuals to be monitored every 3-6 months when HIV RNA > 200 copies/ml or after diagnosis of an AIDS-defining illness (Figure 1). Any treatment change was classified as a nonswitch, ineligible switch, or switch (see Table D1). For example, a change from one protease inhibitor–based regimen to another protease inhibitor–based regimen was not considered a switch, whereas a change from a protease inhibitor–based regimen to an integrase inhibitor–based regimen was considered a switch. Any changes to monotherapy or dual therapy or stopping therapy altogether were considered ineligible switches as they are not consistent with current guidelines.7 The switching thresholds were based on current clinical guidelines and to maximize the number of individuals following distinct strategies (in practice, switching also occurs for reasons other than treatment failure).  4 CANIGLIA ET AL.

We emulated this target trial using observational data from two collaborations of prospective studies from high-income countries. The HIV-CAUSAL Collaboration includes prospective cohort studies from Europe and the Americas.13 The  CANIGLIA ET AL. 5 Strategy 1: Threshold=350 cells/l; Level=200 copies/mlStrategy 2: Threshold=350 cells/l; Level=1000 copies/ml Strategy 3: Threshold=500 cells/l; Level=200 copies/ml Strategy 4: Threshold=500 cells/l; Level=1000 copies/ml CD4>threshold RNA 200 no AIDSat time t yes Switch treatment ifRNA>level Monitor CD4 and RNAagain in 9-12 months no Switch treatment ifRNA>level Monitor CD4 and RNAagain in3-6 months FIGURE 1 Schematic of four dynamic monitoring and treatment strategies to be followed at each time t of follow-up. By considering the combinations of two CD4 cell count thresholds (350 and 500 cells/μl) and two HIV-RNA levels (200 and 1000 copies/ml), four strategies are defined individual cohort studies are FHDH-ANRSC04 (France), ANRS PRIMO (France), ANRS SEROCO (France), ANRS CO3-Aquitaine (France), UK CHIC (United Kingdom), UK Register of HIV Seroconverts (United Kingdom), ATHENA (the Netherlands), SHCS (Switzerland), PISCIS (Spain), CoRIS/CoRIS-MD (Spain), GEMES (Spain), VACS (United States), AMACS (Greece), IPEC (Brazil), and SAC (Canada). The Center for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clin- ical Systems (CNICS) contains clinical data from inpatient and outpatient encounters of HIV-positive individuals at eight US sites: Case Western Reserve University, Fenway Community Health Clinic, Johns Hopkins University, University of Alabama at Birmingham, University of California at San Diego, University of California at San Francisco, University of North Carolina, and University of Washington.14 All cohorts included in the HIV-CAUSAL and CNICS Collaborations were assembled prospectively and are based on data collected for clinical purposes. To emulate the target trial, we identified HIV-positive individuals who met the eligibility criteria, classified them into the four strategies (see below), and followed them until the event of interest, pregnancy, loss to follow-up (12 months after the most recent laboratory measurement), 5 years of follow-up, or the cohort-specific administrative end of follow-up, whichever occurred earlier. To allow more individuals to follow each strategy over time, our primary analysis included an additional month before and after each monitoring window (eg, 3-6 ± 1), so that the monitoring grace period was 5 months. In the next sections, we describe how to estimate the per-protocol effect in the target trial and using observational data. 3 ESTIMATING THE PER-PROTOCOL EFFECT 3.1 Specification of per-protocol analysis in the target trial Eligible individuals are randomized at enrollment in the trial to one of the four joint monitoring and treatment strategies. We define the per-protocol effect as the difference in 5-year survival and AIDS-free survival between the four strategies if all individuals have followed their assigned strategies as indicated in the protocol of the target trial. We describe a three-step procedure to estimate the per-protocol effect in the target trial.  6 CANIGLIA ET AL. First, censor individuals when they deviate from their assigned strategy. Specifically, censor individuals when they are monitored sooner than indicated by their strategy, when they are not monitored soon enough, when they change treat- ment sooner than indicated by their strategy, when they have not switched at the end of the 3-month treatment-switching grace period, when they switch treatment again after their initial treatment switch, when only a CD4 cell count or HIV-RNA measurement is recorded (uneven monitoring), or when they switch to an ineligible treatment regimen (Figure 2). Second, fit a discrete-time hazards model and use its predicted values to estimate standardized survival and AIDS-free survival curves.6,18,19 For example, the discrete-time hazard at each month t can be estimated by fitting a pooled logis- tic model such as logit Pr(Dt+1 = 1|Dt = 0, Ct = 0, X, V) = 𝜃0 + h (t) + 𝜃′ 1V + 𝜃2X350−tight control + 𝜃3X350−loose control + 𝜃4X500−loose control + 𝜃′ 5X350−tight controlh (t) + 𝜃′ 6X350−loose controlh (t) + 𝜃′ 7X500−loose controlh (t), where 𝜃0 + h(t) is a time-varying intercept, with h(t) defined as a restricted cubic spline for follow-up time (four knots at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months), Dt is an indicator for developing the outcome by month t (1: yes, 0: no), V is a vector of baseline prognostic factors that predict adherence, the X's are indicators for the corresponding strategy (1: yes, 0: no) with the strategy CD4 threshold 500/tight control as the reference, and Ct = 0 is an indicator for the remaining uncensored through t.

We include product terms between h(t) and the X's so that the estimated hazard ratios can vary over time. The model uses a smooth function to combine information from each strategy, producing more stable estimates than a nonparametric estimate of the survival function (eg, Kaplan-Meier).6 This model adjusts for baseline (time-fixed) prognostic factors, but not for post-baseline (time-varying) factors because the inclusion of post-baseline covariates in the model for the outcome may introduce selection bias.20 Third, estimate inverse probability (IP) weights to adjust for post-baseline prognostic factors. To describe the weights, we need to introduce some additional notation. Let At = 2 indicate that the individual switches to an eligible regimen at time t, At = 1 indicate that the individual switches to an ineligible regimen during time t, and At = 0 indicate that the individual does not switch treatment during time t. Let Nt = 2 indicate that the individual has both CD4 cell count and HIV-RNA measurements during time t, Nt = 1 indicate that the individual has either a CD4 cell count or an HIV-RNA measurement during time t but not both, and Nt = 0 indicate that the individual has neither a CD4 cell count nor an HIV-RNA measurement during time t. We use overbars to denote the history of a time-dependent variable: Nt is the individual's monitoring history through time t, ̄At is the individual treatment-switching history through time t, and ̄Lt is the individual time-varying covariate history through time t. The nonstabilized IP treatment-switching weight for each uncensored individual at each time t is WA t = ∏t k=0 1 Pr ( Ck = 0|Ck−1 = 0, Dk = 0, X = x, ̄Lk, Nk, ̄Ak−1 ). Pr(Ck = 0|Ck−1 = 0, Dk = 0, X = x, ̄Lk, Nk, ̄Ak−1) is equal to 𝑓(Ak| ̄Ak−1, Dk = 0, ̄Lk, Nk) before and after the treatment-switching grace period, where 𝑓(Ak| ̄Ak−1, Dk = 0, ̄Lk, Nk) is the conditional probability density function 𝑓Ak∣ ̄Ak−1,Dk=0,̄Lk,Nk(ak|ak−1, dk = 0, lk, nk) with (ak|ak−1, dk = 0, lk, nk) evaluated at the random argument (Ak| ̄Ak−1, Dk = 0, ̄Lk, Nk) and is equal to 1 − Pr(Ak = 1| ̄Ak−1, Dk = 0, ̄Lk, Nk) during the treatment-switching grace period.6,21 We estimate Pr(Ak = ak| ̄Ak−1, Dk = 0, ̄Lk, Nk) via a pooled multinomial logistic regression model fit in the original data. Alternatively, we could fit two nested logistic models: a model for ineligible treatment switching and a model for an eligible treatment switch (versus no switch) conditional on not having an ineligible treatment switch (Appendix A). Similarly, the nonstabilized IP monitoring weights are WN t = ∏t k=0 1 Pr ( Ck = 0|Ck−1 = 0, Dk = 0, X = x, ̄Lk−1, Nk−1, ̄Ak−1 ). Pr(Ck = 0|Ck−1 = 0, Dk = 0, X = x, ̄Lk−1, Nk−1, ̄Ak−1) is equal to 𝑓(Nk|Nk−1, Dk = 0, ̄Lk−1, ̄Ak−1) before and after the monitoring grace period, where 𝑓(Nk|Nk−1, Dk = 0, ̄Lk−1, ̄Ak−1) is the conditional probability mass func- tion 𝑓Nk∣Nk−1,Dk=0,̄Lk−1, ̄Ak−1(nk|nk−1, dk = 0, lk−1, ak−1) with (nk|nk−1, dk = 0, lk−1, ak−1) evaluated at the random argument (Nk|Nk−1, Dk = 0, ̄Lk−1, ̄Ak−1) and is equal to 1 − Pr(Nk = 1|Nk−1, Dk = 0, ̄Lk−1, ̄Ak−1) during the monitoring grace period. We estimate Pr(Nk = nk|Nk−1, Dk = 0, ̄Lk−1, ̄Ak−1) via a pooled multinomial logistic model fit in the original data. Alter- natively, we could fit two nested logistic models: a model for uneven monitoring (only a CD4 cell count or HIV-RNA measurement is recorded) and a model for CD4 and RNA monitoring (versus no monitoring) conditional on not having uneven monitoring (Appendix A). All models include a time-varying intercept; monitoring history Nk summarized by the proportion of months of follow-up from baseline to time k with a CD4 cell count measurement (restricted cubic splines with three knots at 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5), the proportion of months of follow-up from baseline to time k with an RNA measurement (restricted cubic splines with three knots at 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5), months between time k and the last CD4 cell count measurement (restricted cubic splines with three knots at 1, 4, and 7), and months between time k and the last RNA measurement (restricted cubic splines with three knots at 1, 4, and 7); treatment-switching history ̄Ak summarized by whether an individual switched treatment from baseline to time k (yes/no) and the number of months between time k and the treatment switch (restricted cubic splines with three knots at 0, 6, and 12); and covariate history ̄Lk summarized by V and Lk, which includes the most recently recorded values of CD4 cell count (restricted cubic splines with five knots at 200, 350, 500, 650, and 1000 cells/μl), HIV RNA (≤200, 201-999, 1000-9999, ≥10 000 copies/ml), and diagnosis of an AIDS-defining illness (when the outcome was all-cause mortality) at time k.  8 CANIGLIA ET AL. The nonstabilized IP weight Wt for each person-month is the product of the treatment-switching weight and the mon- itoring weight Wt = WA t ∗ WN t . We truncate the estimated weights Wt at the 99th percentile to protect against potential model misspecification and near violations of positivity. Under the assumptions of sequential exchangeability, positivity, and consistency for monitoring and treatment switch- ing conditional on the measured time-fixed and time-varying covariates,11 the parameters of the IP-weighted discrete-time hazards model consistently estimate the parameters of a dynamic marginal structural discrete-time hazards model, ie, logit Pr(Dx t+1 = 1|Dx t = 0, V) = 𝛽0 + h (t) + 𝛽′ 1V + 𝛽2x350−tight control + 𝛽3x350−loose control + 𝛽4x500−loose control + 𝛽′ 5x350−tight controlh (t) + 𝛽′ 6x350−loose controlh (t) + 𝛽′ 7x500−loose controlh (t) , where Dx t is, for each individual, a (counterfactual) indicator for developing the outcome by month t (1: yes, 0: no) under strategy X = x for monitoring and treatment. The validity of this procedure also requires no misspecification of the models used to estimate the weights and of the discrete-time hazards model. The nonstabilized IP weights defined above imply strategies under which individuals who were not monitored or did not switch during the corresponding grace period are forced to be monitored or switch treatment at the end of the grace period.6 Since this can lead to unstable estimates and may not be consistent with clinical practice, we also consider IP weights that estimate strategies under which individuals are monitored with a uniform probability during the monitoring grace period and switch treatment with a uniform probability during the treatment-switching grace period.6 Appendix A shows the contributions to the monitoring and treatment-switching weights at different time points for both the non- stabilized and uniform IP weights. We used nonparametric bootstrapping with 500 samples to compute 95% confidence intervals around our estimates. Even if the data on monitoring and treatment strategy assignment had been inadvertently erased from the analysis file in the target trial, one can still construct consistent estimators of the per-protocol effects under exchangeability, consis- tency, and positivity. In fact, Robins shows that the most efficient estimator of the per-protocol effect ignores data on assignment even when available.22 The following section describes estimators that ignore data on assignment to emulate the per-protocol analysis of a target trial using observational data. 3.2 Emulation of the per-protocol analysis using observational data The observational per-protocol analysis is the same as described above for the target trial except that data on monitoring and treatment strategy assignment are absent as no such assignment occurred. In fact, an individual's data at baseline may be consistent with more than one of the four strategies of interest. As previously described in detail,6,7,23 we solved this problem by creating an expanded data set with four exact replicates of each individual (one per strategy), each following one of the strategies of interest. We censored each replicate, as described above, when the individual's data were no longer consistent with the strategy assigned to the replicate. Appendix B describes data for three hypothetical individuals and the strategies they followed over 24 months of follow-up time. To estimate the per-protocol effect, we used the same IP-weighted pooled logistic model described for the target trial, except that we fitted the model to the expanded data set. The models for the weights were fit in the original unexpanded data set.

SAS programs are available at https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/causal/hiv. 3.3 Data analysis results In our analysis, 41 724 individuals met the eligibility criteria and were included. After 2 years of follow-up, 1006 indi- viduals were following the CD4 threshold 350/tight control strategy, 2634 individuals were following the CD4 threshold 500/tight control strategy, 1050 individuals were following the CD4 threshold 350/loose control strategy, and 2741 individ- uals were following the CD4 threshold 500/loose control strategy. After 5 years of follow-up, these numbers were 45, 152, 47, and 164, respectively (Figure 3). Over the 5-year follow-up, there were 455 deaths and 1151 cases of AIDS-defining ill- ness or death (Table 2). The median (interquartile range) time from baseline to death among individuals who died was 5 (2, 10) months. Figure 4 plots the estimated 5-year survival and 5-year AIDS-free survival. Compared with the CD4 thresh- old 500/tight control strategy, the 5-year survival difference was 0.01 (−0.01, 0.04) for the CD4 threshold 350/tight control strategy, 0.01 (−0.02, 0.03) for the CD4 threshold 350/loose control strategy, and 0.00 (−0.01, 0.01) for the CD4 threshold  CANIGLIA ET AL. 9 FIGURE 3 Number of replicates following each monitoring and treatment strategy over follow-up time, without (left) and with (right) the “no direct effect” assumption (Center for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems and HIV-CAUSAL Collaboration, 2000-2015) 500/loose control. The 5-year AIDS-free survival difference was 0.00 (−0.02, 0.03) for the CD4 threshold 350/tight control strategy, 0.00 (−0.02, 0.02) for the CD4 threshold 350/loose control strategy, and 0.00 (0.00, 0.01) for the CD4 threshold 500/loose control strategy, compared with the CD4 threshold 500/tight control strategy (Table 2). 4 ESTIMATING THE PER-PROTOCOL EFFECT WITH A “NO DIRECT EFFECT” ASSUMPTION In many settings, it can be argued that monitoring has no direct effect on the outcome except through aiding decisions regarding switching treatment. For example, in our study, we can assume that having a laboratory measurement can only affect the risk of AIDS or death by triggering treatment changes. More precisely, consider a target trial with two arms in which both arms are assigned the same static treatment strategy but different monitoring strategies. Then, the “no direct effect” assumption says that the two arms will have the same survival curves. By emulating this type of target trial with observational data, it is, in principle, possible to test the “no direct effect” assumption under sequential exchangeability, positivity, and consistency.24 Under the assumption of no direct effect of monitoring, measurements inconsistent with the monitoring strategy have no effect on survival. Therefore, CD4 and HIV-RNA measurements at months not consistent with the monitoring strat- egy can be ignored, and replicates need not be censored at those times. Because these individuals are not censored, we will have more individuals continuing to follow the strategies of interest at any given time and, therefore, more precise effect estimates. Under the “no direct effect” assumption, individuals can no longer be censored for being monitored too frequently but can still be censored for not being monitored frequently enough. In fact, it is possible for the counter- factual survival curve under a particular monitoring and treatment strategy to be identified under the “no direct effect” assumption but to be unidentified (due to lack of positivity) without the assumption.11 For example, if all subjects in the observational data were monitored every month, it would not be possible to identify the effect of any less frequent monitoring strategy without the “no direct effect” assumption. To implement the modified per-protocol analysis that incorporates the “no direct effect” assumption, we construct a “no direct effect” version of the data using the following algorithm, formalized previously by Robins et al. Specifically, the algorithm described next implements Equation 31 on page 4711, extended to allow for random treatment regimes as well as random monitoring regimes11: (i) recode the monitoring indicator at each month t to 0 when an individual is monitored at a time t inconsistent with his or her randomization arm's monitoring strategy (including when only CD4 cell count or HIV RNA is measured), (ii) delete the CD4 cell count and HIV RNA recorded at month t whenever the monitoring indicator at time t has been recoded to 0, and (iii) carry forward the previous CD4 cell count and HIV RNA until the next  10 CANIGLIA ET AL.

The curves are standardized by the baseline covariates: sex, CD4 cell count (≤200, 201-350, 351-500, ≥501 cells/μl), years since HIV diagnosis (<1, 1 to 4, ≥5 years, unknown), race (white, black, other, or unknown), geographic origin (N.

In this “no direct effect” data set, we then proceed to censor individuals when they deviate from their assigned strategy and to estimate the survival and AIDS-free survival for each strategy, as described above. To emulate the target trial using the observational data, we modify the expanded data set in the same way to construct a “no direct effect” data set. The algorithm described above can be extended to strategies with grace periods, which allows even more individuals to follow the strategies of interest over a long period of time. The algorithm can be adapted to handle more than one monitoring time during a grace period. To extend the algorithm, replicates monitored during the monitoring grace period are further replicated, as a way of simulating monitoring trajectories where replicates are monitored at different times during the monitoring grace period.11 Specifically, a replicate monitored during the grace period is cloned at the point of their first measurement in the grace period into two new replicates 1t and 2t, where t denotes the time in the grace period the cloning occurred. For replicate 1t, the new CD4 cell count and HIV-RNA measurements are revealed (recorded for data analysis), and the replicate exits the monitoring grace period in the usual way. For replicate 2t, the new CD4 cell count and HIV-RNA measurements are ignored, ie, the monitoring indicator is recoded to 0, the CD4 and HIV-RNA measurements are deleted, the previous CD4 and RNA measurements are carried forward, and replicate 2t moves to the next month of the grace period. Replicates are only censored if they are not monitored at least as frequently as required by the strategy. As an example, replicate 2t will be censored if she receives no further monitoring during the grace period. Appendix C describes the “no direct effect” data set for one hypothetical individual, first under strategies that require individuals to be monitored exactly every 6 months if their CD4 cell count falls below the strategy's threshold and exactly every 12 months otherwise and, second, under strategies with grace periods. Under the “no direct effect” assumption, the monitoring weights WN t are equal to ∏t k∶N∗(k)=2 1 𝑓 ( Nk|Nk−1,Dk=0,̄Lk−1, ̄Ak−1 ), where N *(k) = 2 denotes times k when a replicate's CD4 and HIV-RNA values are revealed. The factors in the denomina- tor of WN t are 1 at all times when a replicate's CD4 and HIV-RNA values are not revealed (Appendix A).11 The treatment weights remain as before. Note that different replicates from a single person will have different weights. Below, we com- pare the efficiency of the estimates with and without the “no direct effect” assumption when using uniform IP weights (Table 2). 4.1 Data analysis results After 5 years of follow-up, 28 997 individuals were following the CD4 threshold 350/tight control strategy, 24 901 individ- uals were following the CD4 threshold 500/tight control strategy, 30 334 individuals were following the CD4 threshold  12 CANIGLIA ET AL.

The curves are standardized by the baseline covariates: sex, CD4 cell count (≤200, 201-350, 351-500, ≥501 cells/μl), years since HIV diagnosis (<1, 1 to 4, ≥5 years, unknown), race (white, black, other, or unknown), geographic origin (N.

Over the 5-year follow-up, there were 5886 deaths and 9758 cases of AIDS-defining illness or death (Table 2). The median (interquartile range) time to death among individuals who died was 14 (6, 28) months. Figure 5 plots the estimated 5-year survival and 5-year AIDS-free survival. Compared with the CD4 threshold 500/tight control strategy, the 5-year survival difference was 0.00 (0.00, 0.00) for the CD4 threshold 350/tight control strategy, 0.00 (0.00, 0.00) for the CD4 threshold 350/loose control strategy, and 0.00 (0.00, 0.00) for the CD4 threshold 500/loose control strategy. The 5-year AIDS-free survival difference was 0.00 (0.00, 0.01) for the CD4 threshold 350/tight control strategy, 0.00 (−0.01, 0.01) for the CD4 threshold 350/loose control strategy, and 0.00 (−0.01, 0.00) for the CD4 threshold 500/loose control strategy, compared with the CD4 threshold 500/tight control strategy (Table 2). These estimates under the “no direct effect” assumption were more precise than those in the previous section. For example, the standard errors for the 5-year survival difference estimates ranged from 0.0046 to 0.0131 without the “no direct effect” assumption and from 0.0017 to 0.0019 with the “no direct effect” assumption, implying the ratio of the effective sample size under the “no direct effect” assumption to that without the assumption ranging from 7 to 53. 5 DISCUSSION This paper describes the use of observational data to emulate a target trial of joint monitoring and treatment strategies. We applied the method to strategies for the management of HIV-positive individuals and found no differences on survival and AIDS-free survival between strategies with monitoring at a CD4 threshold of 350 cells/μl compared with 500 cells/μl and with treatment switching at an HIV-RNA threshold of 1000 copies/ml compared with 200 copies/ml. Like for any other observational study, the validity of our estimates relies on the untestable assumption that the mea- sured covariates were sufficient to adjust for confounding and selection bias. In our analysis, we adjusted for several joint predictors of monitoring and the outcome as well as of treatment switching and the outcome. If physicians monitor indi- viduals perceived to have lower adherence with greater frequency or make different decisions about treatment switching based on perceived adherence, which we did not directly adjust for, this assumption may not hold. However, we were able to adjust for several potential proxies of adherence, such as HIV RNA. In addition, our results could be biased if both the monitoring frequency and survival vary by site. However, the monitoring frequency was similar between the countries included in our analysis (data not shown).  CANIGLIA ET AL. 13 One challenge in estimating the effect of complex treatment strategies using observational data is that few individuals may have data consistent with the strategies of interest over an extended period of follow-up. We described how to ame- liorate this by incorporating the often plausible assumption that monitoring has no direct effect on the outcome, except through aiding decisions regarding when to switch treatment. The “no direct effect” assumption is advantageous because it increases the number of individuals whose data are consistent with the strategies of interest and does not require addi- tional modeling assumptions. In fact, our survival and AIDS-free survival estimates were similar with and without the “no direct effect” assumption, but the estimates under the “no direct effect” assumption were more precise. The “no direct effect” assumption may not be met if contact with health facilities improves outcomes through inter- ventions that are either unrecorded in the database or not included as additional types of “treatments” in addition to treatment switching. For example, if HIV care is integrated with other services like screening for cancer or cardiovascu- lar disease, or if physicians use the results of a CD4 cell test to initiate treatments other than that under consideration (eg, prophylaxis for opportunistic infections), the assumption may not hold (unless the strategy includes screening and/or prophylaxis as additional “treatments”). However, under the strategies of interest, individuals with low CD4 cell counts were monitored frequently (every 2-7 months), and so, few CD4 tests were deleted for these individuals when creating the modified data set (in the analysis without the “no direct effect” assumption, only 4% of replicates censored for being monitored too frequently had a CD4 cell count ≤200 cells/μl at the time they were censored). The monitoring and treatment strategies in our primary analysis did not consider treatment switches after the initial treatment switch. While strategies that allow arbitrary treatment switches would be more realistic,25 they are also com- putationally harder to implement under the “no direct effect” assumption. In a sensitivity analysis without the “no direct effect” assumption, we considered modified strategies that allowed treatment switches both before virologic failure and after the initial treatment switch. This analysis yielded similar results (5-year survival difference compared with the CD4 threshold 500/tight control strategy: 0.01 (−0.01, 0.02) for the CD4 threshold 350/tight control strategy, 0.01 (−0.01, 0.04) for the CD4 threshold 350/loose control strategy, and 0.01 (0.00, 0.01) for the CD4 threshold 500/loose control strategy). The methods described in this paper can be extended to other joint monitoring and treatment strategies analyzed in health research. The “no direct effect” assumption can be a useful tool in settings where individuals are monitored or tested often, but inferences about less frequent monitoring or testing are desired. For example, this approach may be particularly useful when data from a high-resource population with frequent testing are available but researchers want to apply the estimates to a low-resource population with infrequent testing.11 DISCLOSURES The funders had no role in the study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.

Their CD4 cell count increased from 300 to 380, then to 400, then to 430, and, finally, to 500. The difference between the three individuals was that individual 1 never experienced virologic failure (HIV RNA > 200 copies/ml), individual 2 experienced virologic failure at month 6 and switched treatment imme- diately, and individual 3 experienced virologic failure at month 6 but did not switch treatment until month 12. Individual 2 achieved virologic suppression (HIV RNA ≤ 200 copies/ml) again at month 18, and individual 3 achieved virologic suppression at month 24. Individual 1 was censored from the threshold 350 strategies at month 12 because she was mon- itored at an interval shorter than 9-12 months while her CD4 cell count was above the 350 threshold. Individual 2 was censored from the loose-control strategies at month 6 when she switched treatment before her HIV RNA crosses above 1000 copies/ml and was censored from the remaining 350 threshold strategy at month 24 because she was monitored at an interval shorter than 9-12 months while her CD4 cell count was above the 350 threshold and her HIV RNA ≤ 200 copies/ml. Individual 3 was censored from the tight-control strategies at month 9 when she did not switch treatment within 3 months of her HIV RNA crossing above 200 copies/ml.

In the “no direct effect” data set, we changed the observations for the two replicates following the threshold 350 strategies as follows: we (i) recoded the monitoring indicator at month 12 to 0, (ii) discarded the CD4 cell count and HIV-RNA measurement recorded at month 12, and (iii) carried forward the CD4 cell count and HIV RNA from month 11 until the next time the individual was monitored at month 18. The monitoring indicator was again recoded to 0 at month 24. Monitoring is recoded to 0 at months 12 and 24 for the replicates following the threshold 350 strategies because they are monitored sooner than indi- cated by the strategy (every 6 months rather than every 12 months). Under the “no direct effect” assumption, individual 1 followed all four strategies for the first 24 months of follow-up. This “no direct effect” data set is shown in Table C1.1. Note that we exclude HIV RNA from the Table for simplicity. Table C1.2 shows the “no direct effect” data for individual 1 under strategies with grace periods (monitor every 2-7 months if CD4 is above the threshold and every 8-13 months if CD4 is below the threshold). Consider the replicate fol- lowing the threshold 350–tight control strategy. When this replicate is monitored at month 6, during a monitoring grace period, the replicate is split into two new replicates 16 and 26. New replicate 16 has her new CD4 cell count and HIV-RNA measurements revealed and reenters the grace period in the usual way. This new replicate 16 is again split into two new replicates when monitored during another monitoring grace period at month 18. New replicate 26 has her monitoring at month 6 ignored (because she could still be monitored at month 7), moves to the next month of the monitoring grace period, and is censored at month 7 for not being monitored at the end of the grace period. The replicate following the threshold 350–loose control strategy is split at the same time points as the replicate following the threshold 350–tight con- trol strategy. The two replicates following the threshold 500 strategies are split when monitored during grace periods at months 6, 12, 18, and 24. By leveraging the grace periods and the “no direct effect” assumption, six replicates correspond- ing to this hypothetical individual remain under follow-up at 24 months of follow-up: one follows the threshold 350–tight control strategy, one follows the threshold 350–loose control strategy, two follow the threshold 500–tight control strategy, and two follow-up the threshold 500–loose control strategy.

Leaf4 on behalf of the STOP‑COVID Investigators © 2021 Springer‑Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature AbstractPurpose: Limited data are available on venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in patients withsevere hypoxemic respiratory failure from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). Methods: We examined the clinical features and outcomes of 190 patients treated with ECMO within 14 days of ICUadmission, using data from a multicenter cohort study of 5122 critically ill adults with COVID‑19 admitted to 68 hospi‑ tals across the United States. To estimate the effect of ECMO on mortality, we emulated a target trial of ECMO receiptversus no ECMO receipt within 7 days of ICU admission among mechanically ventilated patients with severe hypox‑ emia(PaO2/FiO2 < 100). Patients were followed until hospital discharge, death, or a minimum of 60 days. We adjustedfor confounding using a multivariable Cox model. Results: Among the 190 patients treated with ECMO, the median age was 49 years (IQR 41–58), 137 (72.1%) were men,and the medianPaO2/FiO2 prior to ECMO initiation was 72 (IQR 61–90). At 60 days, 63 patients (33.2%) had died, 94 (49.5%)were discharged, and 33 (17.4%) remained hospitalized. Among the 1297 patients eligible for the target trial emulation, 45of the 130 (34.6%) who received ECMO died, and 553 of the 1167 (47.4%) who did not receive ECMO died. In the primaryanalysis, patients who received ECMO had lower mortality than those who did not (HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.41–0.74). Resultswere similar in a secondary analysis limited to patients withPaO2/FiO2 < 80 (HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.40–0.77). Conclusion: In select patients with severe respiratory failure from COVID‑19, ECMO may reduce mortality.

For patients who experience progressive respiratoryfailure despite these conventional therapies, venovenousextracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may beconsidered to support gas exchange and minimize ven- tilator-induced lung injury [4, 5]. ECMO has been usedfor decades in the treatment of severe ARDS of variousetiologies. Recent clinical trials evaluated the efficacy andsafety of ECMO in severe ARDS [6, 7], with a survivalbenefit demonstrated in a meta-analysis [8]. Early reports from China, Europe, and the UnitedStates on the use of ECMO in patients with respira- tory failure from COVID-19 have been limited by mod- est sample sizes and short follow-up [9–17]. Morerecent studies report larger numbers of patients whoreceived ECMO, yet still suffer from lack of a compara- tive non-ECMO control group [18, 19]. Additional dataare urgently needed to inform the potential efficacy andsafety of ECMO in critically ill adults with severe respira- tory failure from COVID-19. To address this knowledge gap, we used data from amulticenter cohort study of critically ill patients withCOVID-19 admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) acrossthe United States to describe the clinical characteristics,physiologic parameters, complications, and outcomesof patients who initiated treatment with ECMO in thefirst 14 days of ICU admission. To estimate the effect ofECMO on survival in patients with COVID-19, we emu- lated a target trial in which patients with severe hypox- emic respiratory failure were categorized as havinginitiated or not initiated ECMO in the first 7 days of ICUadmission. Methods Study design and oversight We used data from the Study of the Treatment and Out- comes in Critically Ill Patients with COVID-19 (STOP- COVID), a multicenter cohort study that enrolledconsecutive adults (≥ 18 years old) with laboratory-con- firmed COVID-19 admitted to participating ICUs at 68geographically diverse hospitals across the United States[20]. The study was approved with a waiver of informedconsent by the Institutional Review Board at each partici- pating site. Study sites and patient population A total of 55 of the 68 participating hospitals in STOP- COVID were capable of treating patients with ECMO(TableE1). We included patients with COVID-19 whowere admitted to an ICU at one of these 55 ECMO-capa- ble participating hospitals between March 1 and July 1,2020 (Fig. E1). Patients were considered to have receivedECMO if they underwent cannulation for venovenousECMO within 14 days following ICU admission (patientsreceiving venoarterial or veno-arterial-venous ECMOwere excluded). We followed patients until hospital dis- charge, death, or September 1, 2020. All patients whoremained hospitalized at the time of analysis had a mini- mum of 60 days of follow-up. Data collection Study personnel at each site collected data by manualchart review and used a standardized case report formto enter data using a secure, web-based platform [21].Data included baseline information on demographics,coexisting conditions, symptoms, home medications,and vital signs on ICU admission, as well as daily datafollowing ICU admission on laboratory and physiologicparameters (including the ratio of the partial pressureof arterial oxygen over the fraction of inspired oxygen [PaO2/FiO2]), medications, non-medication treatments,organ support, and outcome data on ICU and hospitallength of stay and death. Among patients who receivedECMO, additional data were collected on respiratorymechanics and ventilator parameters pre- and post- ECMO cannulation. Definitions of variables are pro- vided in Table E2. Statistical analysis for descriptive cohort To describe baseline characteristics, treatment, and out- comes in patients who received ECMO within 14daysof ICU admission, continuous variables are expressed asmedian and interquartile range and categorical variablesare presented as count and percentage. Among patientswho received ECMO, differences between 60-day sur- vivors and non-survivors were analyzed with a t test orMann–Whitney U test for continuous data and with aChi-square or Fisher’s Exact test for categorical data,Take‑home messageIn this multicenter cohort study of critically ill adults with COVID‑19,190 of 5122 patients (3.7%) received ECMO, 127 (66.8%) of whomsurvived to hospital discharge or 60 days. After accounting for dif‑ ferences between groups, patients with severe hypoxemia(PaO2/ FiO2 < 100) who received ECMO in the first 7 days of ICU admissionhad lower in‑hospital mortality than patients who did not (hazardratio 0.55; 95% CI 0.41–0.74).  210 as appropriate. Patients who were discharged prior to60 days were considered to be alive at 60 days. Eligibility criteria for the emulated trial To estimate the effect of ECMO on survival, we emu- lated a target trial comparing patients who initiatedECMO in the first 7days of ICU admission to thosewho did not. Seven days was chosen as the time periodfor treatment assignment to provide greater homogene- ity between patients, to allow for more follow-up time,and to be consistent with major trial exclusion criteriaand consensus guidelines [2, 6, 7, 22]. To emulate theeligibility criteria of a clinical trial of ECMO in patientswith severe ARDS [23], we included patients with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 100mmHg while receiving invasivemechanical ventilation, and we excluded patients if theyhad any of the following characteristics: over 70yearsold; malignancy treated in the prior year; treatment withvenoarterial ECMO; or admission to an ICU at a hospi- tal incapable of providing ECMO.PaO2/FiO2 ratio wasassessed as the lowestPaO2 value (with the correspond- ingFiO2 value) on the day of ECMO initiation/non-initi- ation or the day prior. Target trial emulation The primary analysis compares the survival amongECMO initiators versus ECMO non-initiators. On day1 of ICU admission, patients were categorized in theECMO group if they received ECMO and were catego- rized in the non-ECMO group if they did not receiveECMO. We repeated this procedure on days 2 through7 for eligible patients who had not previously receivedECMO. This approach eliminates the immortal timebias that would result from comparing patients initiatingECMO at a later time point (e.g., ICU day 5) to patientswho did not receive ECMO at an earlier time point (e.g.,ICU day 1) [24]. Patients were followed from the date ofECMO initiation or non-initiation until death, hospitaldischarge, or the end of follow-up, whichever occurredfirst. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals(CIs) were estimated using a Cox model. The final esti- mates of the effect of ECMO on survival were obtainedby pooling the data from the emulation of the nested tar- get trials on days 1 through seven of ICU admission. Multivariable adjustment for confounding We adjusted for confounding using a multivariable Coxmodel. The following covariates were prespecified basedon clinical judgment and prior knowledge [20], as theywere felt to potentially be associated with both ECMOreceipt and with survival: age (18–49; 50–59; 60–70); sex;race (White; non-White); body mass index (< 40; ≥ 40;unknown); hypertension; diabetes mellitus; coronaryartery disease; congestive heart failure; chronic obstruc- tive pulmonary disease (COPD);PaO2/FiO2 ratio (< 80;80–99 mmHg); shock (defined as receipt of at least onevasopressor); suspected or confirmed secondary infec- tion; the renal, liver, and coagulation components of theSequential Organ Failure Assessment score [25, 26]; andreceipt of rescue therapies for hypoxemia (prone posi- tion ventilation, neuromuscular blockade, and inhaledvasodilators, each assessed separately). Acute severity ofillness characteristics were assessed on the day of treat- ment assignment. Additional details are provided in theSupplementary Methods. We used a robust (sandwich)variance estimator to account for potential replicationsof patients induced by our nested target trial approach,which results in conservative (wider) 95% CIs. In addi- tion to the time-to-death analyses describe above, wealso estimated the difference in the risk of 60-day mortal- ity in ECMO-treated versus ECMO non-treated patientsusing the marginal probabilities from a logistic regressionmodel that included the covariates listed above. Sensitivity analyses We also conducted a series of sensitivity analyses.First, we treated hospital discharge as a competingrisk rather than a censoring event. Second, as an alter- native approach to the primary analysis to eliminateimmortal time bias, we matched each patient who initi- ated ECMO on day 1 with two randomly selected eli- gible control patients(PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 100mmHgwhile receiving invasive mechanical ventilation) whodid not initiate ECMO. We then repeated the processon days 2 through 7, with ECMO non-treated patientsonly being included once. Third, we limited our anal- ysis to a more homogeneous group of patients withthe following characteristics: < 65years old; absenceof coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure,and COPD; mechanically ventilated and with aPaO2/ FiO2 ratio < 80 mmHg; and receipt of at least one res- cue therapy for hypoxemia (prone position ventilation,neuromuscular blockade, or inhaled vasodilators) priorto ECMO initiation or non-initiation. For each of theabove analyses, we adjusted for confounding by indi- cation using a multivariable Cox model, as describedabove. We performed two additional analyses similar tothe primary analysis, but using alternativePaO2/FiO2thresholds (< 80 and < 150 mmHg) to define eligibility.Finally, to assess the potential for effect modificationaccording to day of treatment assignment, we tested thesignificance of an interaction term (treatment assign- ment × day of treatment [defined as day 1–3 versus day4–7]) introduced into the model. Analyses were per- formed using SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute).  211 Data completeness Rates of missing data overall are shown in Table E3. Withthe exception of body mass index, data were complete forall covariates included in the multivariable models. Miss- ing data for body mass index (8.5% of ECMO recipientsand 3.3% of ECMO non-recipients) were not imputed.Rather, a separate missing category was used. Results Baseline characteristics A total of 5122 critically ill patients with COVID-19 wereadmitted to ICUs during the study period. A total of 190of the 5122 patients (3.7%) received ECMO during the14 days following ICU admission at 35 of the 55 ECMO- capable sites (Figs. 1 and E1). The median age of patientswho received ECMO was 49 years (IQR 41–58) and 137patients (72.1%) were male (Tables1, E3). No patientswho received venovenous ECMO were converted tovenoarterial ECMO. Characteristics prior to ECMO Patients were cannulated at a median of 3days (IQR1–6) following ICU admission, and 83% of patients whoreceived ECMO were cannulated in the first 7days ofICU admission (Figure E2). Among the 188 patients withaPaO2/FiO2 ratio recorded in the 24 h prior to ECMOcannulation, 118 (62.8%) had aPaO2/FiO2 ratio lessthan 80 mmHg, and 157 (83.5%) had aPaO2/FiO2 ratioless than 100 mmHg (Figure E3).PaO2/FiO2 ratio, posi- tive end expiratory pressure, and receipt of therapies forhypoxemia were similar between 60-day survivors andnon-survivors (Table 1). Survivors had a lower incidenceof shock and a higher Respiratory ECMO Survival Pre- diction (RESP) score [27] in the 24h prior to ECMOcannulation compared to non-survivors (Table 1). Complications after ECMO cannulation The most common complications after ECMO can- nulation were bacterial pneumonia (34.7%), bleeding(27.9%), thrombotic events (22.6%), and acute kidneyinjury requiring renal replacement therapy (21.8%). Eightpatients (4.2%) had intracranial hemorrhage and threepatients (1.6%) had an ischemic stroke. Additional out- comes are shown in Table 2. Respiratory and laboratoryparameters 24h post-ECMO cannulation are shown inTable E4. Mortality and length of stay after ECMO cannulation Among the 190 patients who received ECMO, 63 (33.2%)died, 94 (49.5%) were discharged alive, and 33 (17.4%)were still hospitalized at day 60 (Table2). Among thesurvivors, the median ICU and hospital length of staywas 34days (IQR 23–48) and 46days (IQR 34–61),respectively (Table 2). When followed until the last dateof follow-up, 67 patients (35.3%) had died, 114 (60%)were discharged alive, and only 9 (4.7%) were still hospi- talized. Of those who were discharged alive, 57 (50.4%)were discharged home, 53 (46.5%) were discharged toa rehabilitation facility, 3 (2.7%) were transferred toanother hospital, and 1 (0.9%) was missing data on dis- charge location (Table E5). Of the 53 patients dischargedto a rehabilitation facility, only 18 (34%) went to a long- term acute care facility capable of providing invasivemechanical ventilation. Early vs. late cannulation Characteristics and outcomes of patients cannulated inthe first compared to the second week following ICUadmission are shown in Table E6. Target trial emulation Among 5122 patients examined, a total of 2068 wereexcluded from the target trial emulation (Fig. 1). Of theremaining 3054 patients, 1297 were eligible for inclusionin the target trial on at least 1 of the 7 days following ICUadmission, 130 (10%) of whom received ECMO and 1167(90%) of whom did not. The characteristics of ECMO- treated and non-treated patients are shown in Table3.Patients treated with ECMO were younger, more likelyto be male, and less likely to have chronic cardiovascu- lar and respiratory disease compared to patients nottreated with ECMO, but were more likely to have shockand a lowerPaO2/FiO2 ratio (Table3). Patients treatedwith ECMO were also more likely to have received rescuetherapies for hypoxemia compared to those not treatedwith ECMO (Table 3). Among the 1297 patients included in the target trial,during a median follow-up of 38days (IQR 25–55), atotal of 598 patients (46.1%) died, including 45 of the 130(34.6%) who received ECMO and 553 of the 1167 (47.4%)who did not (unadjusted HR 0.52; 95% CI 0.4–0.69). Fig- ure2a shows the unadjusted survival curves (log-rankp < 0.001). In the primary analysis, patients who receivedECMO had a lower risk of death compared to those whodid not (adjusted HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.41–0.74). Results ofthe full multivariable model are shown in Table E7. Theestimated 60-day mortality was 35.3% (95% CI 27.2– 43.5%) in the ECMO-treated patients and 47.9% (95%CI 44.9–50.8%) in the ECMO non-treated patients (riskdifference 12.5%; 95% CI 4–21%). Interpretations wereunchanged across all three sensitivity analyses, as well asanalyses using alternativePaO2/FiO2 thresholds to defineeligibility (Fig.2b; Tables E8–E11). No interaction wasobserved between treatment assignment and the day oftreatment initiation (p value for interaction 0.15).  212 Discussion This multicenter cohort study of 190 critically ill adultswith COVID-19 who received ECMO at 35 sites acrossthe United States found that nearly 70% of patients sur- vived to hospital discharge or 60days following ICUadmission. In a target trial emulation, severely hypoxemicpatients who received ECMO in the first 7 days of ICUadmission had a considerably lower risk of death com- pared to those who did not. The current study presents data from a large, geograph- ically diverse cohort from the United States. ECMO wasused in 3% of critically ill adults with COVID-19 in ourstudy; in a recent multicenter European cohort study, 8%of critically ill patients with COVID-19 received ECMO[28]. The 60-day mortality rate of 33% that we observedfor patients with COVID-19 treated with ECMO is simi- lar to short-term mortality rates observed in ECMO- treated patients during prior pandemics, includingmortality rates ranging from 28 to 37% among patientswith H1N1 influenza [29, 30]. Our observed 60-day mor- tality rate is also similar to the 60-day mortality rate of36% reported by a single-center study of 83 ECMO- treated patients with COVID-19 in France, and to the90-day mortality rate of 37% reported in a large multina- tional ELSO study of over 1000 ECMO patients [18, 19]. The median age in our ECMO cohort was 49 years, andno patients over 70 were treated with ECMO. Patientselection guidelines for use of ECMO in COVID-19 arelimited, and experts have suggested adhering to previ- ously established protocols [2]. Over 70% of ECMOpatients in our study underwent prone positioning priorto receiving ECMO, perhaps reflecting that the pandemichas spurred adoption of therapies that have been shownto have benefit but have previously been underutilized.The median pre-cannulationPaO2/FiO2 ratio in patientsfrom our cohort was 72 mmHg, with over 80% of patientshaving aPaO2/FiO2 ratio below 100mmHg, indicatingsevere hypoxemia, albeit not as severe as patients in theFig. 1 Study cohort. Two populations of patients are shown: the descriptive analysis, which includes all patients who initiated ECMO in the first14 days following ICU admission, and the target trial emulation, which includes patients who did or did not initiate ECMO in the first 7 days follow‑ ing ICU admission. For the target trial emulation, patients who initiated ECMO appeared in the pooled dataset up to and including the day thatECMO was initiated. For example, a patient who initiated ECMO on ICU day one did not have a corresponding observation on ICU days two throughseven. A patient who initiated ECMO on ICU day three, meanwhile, appeared as both an ECMO non‑initiator on days one and two and as an ECMOinitiator on day three.

In the EOLIA trial, criteria for ECMO ini- tiation included aPaO2/FiO2 ratio < 50 mmHg for morethan 3 h or aPaO2/FiO2 ratio < 80 mmHg for more than6h [7]. Importantly, our sensitivity analyses performedin patients withPaO2/FiO2 < 80 and < 150 mmHg demon- strated similar hazard ratios for survival as our primaryanalysis. The high rates of complications we observed in patientswith COVID-19 who received ECMO underscores theimportance of patient selection. The most common com- plications were secondary infections, acute kidney injury,thrombotic events, and bleeding. Furthermore, half ofthe patients who survived to hospital discharge requiredsome form of rehabilitation post-discharge, suggestinghigh morbidity in these patients. On the other hand, ourfinding that half of the patients who survived to hospi- tal discharge were discharged home is reassuring thatfavorable outcomes can be achieved with ECMO withproper selection of patients. We also sought to determine the effect of ECMO onsurvival. When data from randomized trials are notavailable, observational analyses may be used to guideTable 1 (continued) Characteristic All ECMO patients (N = 190) ECMO 60-day sur- vivors (N = 127) ECMO 60-day non- survivors (N = 63) p value Respiratory rate,min−1—median (IQR) 27 (22–30) 26 (21–30) 28 (22 to 32) 0.26 Plateau pressure,cmH2O—median (IQR) 30 (28–35) 30 (28–35) 31 (28 to 34) 0.73 Driving pressure,cmH2O—median (IQR) 15 (11–18) 15 (12–18) 15 (11 to 17) 0.99 Compliance,cmH2O−1—median (IQR) 28 (21–36) 27 (19–38) 30 (22 to 36) 0.41 Laboratory values within 24 h prior to ECMO cannula- tionb White cell count, permm3 13.5 (9.2–18.8) 12.9 (9–16.7) 14.5 (9.6 to 21.9) 0.15 Lymphocyte count, permm3 5 (3–8) 6 (3–8) 4 (3 to 7) 0.29 Hemoglobin, g/dl 10.8 (9.5–12) 11.1 (9.9–12.4) 10.2 (9.0 to 11.5) 0.01 Platelet count, permm3 239 (172–302) 247 (191–313) 188 (133 to 274) 0.001 Albumin, g/dl 2.4 (2.1–2.8) 2.5 (2.2–3) 2.3 (2.0 to 2.6) 0.01 Arterial pH—median (IQR) 7.30 (7.23–7.36) 7.31 (7.26–7.36) 7.29 (7.21 to 7.36) 0.08 Lactate, mmol/l 1.9 (1.4–2.9) 1.9 (1.5–2.9) 2.2 (1.4 to 3.1) 0.20 d‑dimer, ng/ml 3483 (1758–6860) 3502 (1758–7429) 3340 (1780 to 5744) 0.59 Timing characteristics—median (IQR) Days from symptom onset to cannulation 13 (10–17) 12 (10–16) 13 (9 to 18) 0.41 Days from hospital admission to cannulation 6 (4–9) 5 (3–7) 6 (4 to 11) 0.01 Days from ICU admission to cannulation 3 (1–6) 3 (0–5) 4 (1 to 6) 0.10 Days from mechanical ventilation to cannulation 2 (0–5) 2 (0–5) 3 (1 to 6) 0.07 Hospital characteristics Number of ICU beds—no.

Accordingly, we conducted a target trial emu- lation in which severely hypoxemic patients were cat- egorized according to receipt or no receipt of ECMOin the first 7 days of ICU admission. We used analyticapproaches to adjust for confounding and preventimmortal time bias. We found that severely hypoxemicpatients treated with ECMO had a considerably lowerrisk of death compared to patients not treated withECMO, with similar results across multiple sensitivityand subgroup analyses. Since randomized controlled tri- als of ECMO use in COVID-19 are unlikely to be feasi- ble in the foreseeable future due to logistical challengesand inevitable cross-over, target trial emulation mayoffer the best available evidence on which to base cur- rent practice. Nevertheless, the findings from our targettrial emulation, which are based on observational data,should be interpreted cautiously since we cannot excludethe potential for residual confounding. Our study has several strengths. We collected granu- lar data (over 800 unique data elements per patient)from a large number of consecutive critically ill patientswith laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, thereby mini- mizing selection or surveillance bias at each center. Weincluded patients from 55 geographically diverse sitesfrom across the United States, thereby increasing thegeneralizability of our findings, and we excluded patientsfrom centers not capable of performing ECMO. All datawere obtained by detailed chart review rather than reli- ance on administrative or billing codes, which havewell-described limitations [31, 35]. Whereas some priorstudies of ECMO in COVID-19 have had limited follow- up, we followed patients until hospital discharge, death,or a minimum of 60 days, which allowed us to ascertainTable 2 Outcomes of patients who received ECMO Outcome definitions are defined in Supplementary Table 2 ECMO extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, ICU intensive care unit, IQR interquartile range, RRTrenal replacement therapy a Values are only reported for patients without end-stage renal disease at baseline Outcome measure All ECMO patients(N = 190) ECMO 60-day survivors(N = 127) ECMO 60-day non-survi- vors (N = 63) p value 60-day outcomes—no.

Finally, the results of ourtarget trial emulation were consistent across multiplesensitivity analyses that used alternative methodologicalapproaches, along with alternative thresholds of hypox- emia to define eligibility. We also acknowledge several limitations. First, aswith all observational analyses, we cannot rule outthe possibility of residual confounding. For exam- ple, we did not account for varying degrees of hospi- tal strain, which could affect outcomes in critical careduring dynamic surges in patient volumes. Second, weacknowledge that sites may have varied in the criteriathey used to determine ECMO candidacy. For example,use of rescue therapies for hypoxemia (prone position- ing, neuromuscular blockade, and inhaled vasodila- tors) prior to ECMO initiation, and use of therapeuticanticoagulation during ECMO, were based on insti- tutional standards of care during the pandemic andreflect site variation in practice. Importantly, our sen- sitivity analysis limited to a more homogeneous groupof patients, including those who received at least onerescue therapy prior to ECMO initiation or non-initi- ation, found similar findings as our primary analysis.Third, inclusion criteria for our target trial emulationincluded assessment of the lowestPaO2/FiO2 in the24 h preceding ECMO cannulation, unlike the EOLIAtrial, which used a set duration of time below aPaO2/ FiO2 threshold. Fourth, we did not collect longitudinaldata on respiratory mechanics beyond 24h or pronepositioning during ECMO [36, 37], which could havebeen used to further assess lung rest, recovery, andrecruitability. It should also be acknowledged that onlymodest reductions in tidal volumes and driving pres- sures were observed in the immediate post-ECMOperiod, somewhat in contrast with other studies dem- onstrating ultraprotective lung ventilation on ECMO[18, 38]. We also did not collect data on lung compli- ance in patients who did not receive ECMO. Fifth,for our descriptive analyses patients discharged priorto 60 days were assumed to still be alive at day 60, anassumption that may have overestimated the 60-daysurvival rate of ECMO recipients. However, we notethat 97% of those discharged were either dischargedhome or to a rehabilitation facility, with only 3% hav- ing been transferred to another hospital. Using data from a nationally representative and geo- graphically diverse multicenter cohort study of criti- cally ill adults with COVID-19 in the United States,we found that 190 patients were treated with ECMO.Among those treated with ECMO, two-thirds sur- vived to hospital discharge or 60 days. Using target trialemulation, we found that selected patients with severehypoxemic respiratory failure treated with ECMO inthe first 7days of ICU admission had a considerablereduction in mortality compared to those not treatedwith ECMO. Although clear indications for ECMO inCOVID-19 patients are not explicitly provided in thiscohort study, it is evident that a proportion of patientswith severe COVID-19 respiratory failure may wellbenefit from ECMO. Further investigation is warrantedto identify which COVID-19 patients may derive thegreatest benefit from ECMO. Fig. 2 The estimated effect of ECMO on mortality. a Shows the unadjusted survival curves for ECMO‑treated versus ECMO non‑treated patients. bShows the hazard ratios for survival for ECMO‑treated versus ECMO non‑treated patients. The following covariates were included in the multivari‑ able models: age; sex; race; body mass index; hypertension; diabetes mellitus; coronary artery disease; congestive heart failure; chronic obstructivepulmonary disease; shock; suspected or confirmed secondary infection; the renal, liver, and coagulation components of the Sequential OrganFailure Assessment score [25, 26]; and receipt of rescue therapies for hypoxemia (prone position ventilation, neuromuscular blockade, and inhaledvasodilators, each assessed separately). Sensitivity analysis #1 treated hospital discharge as a competing risk rather than as a censoring event. Sen‑ sitivity analysis #2 matched each ECMO‑treated patient on day 1 with two randomly selected eligible control patients(PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 100 mmHgwhile receiving invasive mechanical ventilation) who did not initiate ECMO, and the process was then repeated on days 2 through 7, with ECMOnon‑treated patients only being used once. Sensitivity analysis #3 was limited to patients with the following characteristics: < 65 years old; absenceof coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and COPD; mechanically ventilated and with aPaO2/FiO2 ratio < 80 mmHg; and receipt of at leastone rescue therapy for hypoxemia (prone position ventilation, neuromuscular blockade, or inhaled vasodilators) prior to ECMO initiation or non‑ initiation.

METHODS The value of explicitly emulating a target trial when using real world evidence: an application to colorectal cancer screening Xabier Garcı´a-Albe´niz1,2 • John Hsu2,3 • Miguel A. Herna´n1,4,5 Received: 3 June 2017 / Accepted: 17 July 2017 � Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2017 Abstract Observational analyses for causal inference often rely on real world data collected for purposes other than research. A frequent goal of these observational analyses is to use the data to emulate a hypothetical ran- domized experiment, i.e., the target trial, that mimics the design features of a true experiment, including a clear deﬁnition of time zero with synchronization of treatment assignment and determination of eligibility. We review a recent observational analysis that explicitly emulated a target trial of screening colonoscopy using insurance claims from U.S. Medicare. We then compare this explicit emulation with alternative, simpler observational analyses that do not synchronize treatment assignment and eligi- bility determination at time zero and/or do not allow for repeated eligibility. This empirical comparison suggests that lack of an explicit emulation of the target trial leads to biased estimates, and shows that allowing for repeated eligibility increases the statistical efﬁciency of the estimates. Keywords Colon cancer screening � Target trial � Causal inference In theory, randomized controlled trials can validly address causal questions about the comparative effectiveness or safety of health-related interventions. In practice, the ran- domized trial that would answer a particular causal ques- tion—the target trial—may not be feasible, ethical, or timely. When this is the case, we can resort to observa- tional analyses that use real world data to explicitly emu- late the target trial of interest [1]. As an example of the above, consider the effect of screening colonoscopy on colorectal cancer (CRC) inci- dence [2]. Though screening colonoscopy is thought to reduce CRC incidence, no results from randomized trials will be available until the next decade [3–5]. In the meanwhile, evidence about the effectiveness of screening colonoscopy will necessarily rely on observational anal- yses of real world data [6]. We recently emulated a (hypothetical) target trial of screening colonoscopy using a large insurance claims database from the Medicare program in the United States. We estimated that screening colonoscopy lowers the eight-year risk of CRC risk by 0.63 percentage points in individuals aged 70–74 years [7]. To obtain this estimate of 0.63, we implemented an analytic approach that explicitly emulates a target trial of screening colonoscopy. Our approach was designed to reduce bias and to improve precision when using nonran- domized longitudinal data. However, our approach may appear unnecessarily complex when compared with more Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s10654-017-0287-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. & Xabier Garcı´a-Albe´niz xabi@post.harvard.edu 1 Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

To address this question, here we compare the trial emulation approach with simpler approaches to estimate the effect of screening colonoscopy on the eight-year risk of CRC. We then discuss the relative advantages and dis- advantages of our explicit emulation approach compared with these simpler approaches. First, we brieﬂy review our approach. Overview of the original observational analysis to emulate the target trial We ﬁrst speciﬁed the protocol of a target trial of colono- scopy (Table 1). To emulate this target trial, we identiﬁed Medicare beneﬁciaries who met the eligibility criteria and assigned them to either one of two comparison arms: (1) screening colonoscopy within the seven days after they met the eligibility criteria; or (2) no screening strategy. Follow- up ended at CRC diagnosis, death, disenrollment from Medicare (loss to follow-up), or December 31, 2012, whichever occurred earlier. We compared the eight-year risk of CRC under both strategies [7]. We emulated the target trial both assuming that randomization was condi- tional on the baseline covariates listed in Table 1 and that randomization was unconditional. In practical terms, this means that we conducted two analyses: one adjusted for the baseline covariates and another one unadjusted. Because adjustment for baseline variables did not materially affect the estimates, for simplicity we will only discuss unad- justed estimates here. Also for simplicity, we restrict our discussion to the analysis in the 70–74 years age group. Because eligible individuals could meet the eligibility criteria at multiple weeks during the follow-up period, we emulated 260 target trials (with each trial starting in a different week) and allowed individuals to contribute information to multiple trials depending on eligibility. On average, each individual was eligible for 49.7 of the 52 trials emulated each year for which she was eligible. We analyzed the data by pooling the 260 emulated trials. The statistical analysis accounted for the repeated use of indi- viduals: bootstrapping was used to estimate the variance of the estimates. To decrease the computational demands imposed by the emulation of 260 target trials, we included only a random sample of 5% of individuals assigned to the no screening strategy each week. For comparability, we also used 5% of the eligible individuals in the simpler analyses described below. Under this study design, all 685 CRC cases in the screening strategy were unique, but the 21,954 CRC cases in the no screening strategy corresponded to only 1086 unique cases. 12.8% of eligible individuals were censored due to loss to follow-up; adjustment for potential selection bias using inverse-probability weighting did not materially change the estimates. The CRC risk was greater at time zero in the screening strategy than in the no-screening strategy because previously undiagnosed cancers were diagnosed at baseline, but the curves crossed at about ﬁve years (Fig. 1). The eight-year risk difference was -0.63% (95% CI: -0.83, -0.43) (Table 2). Three alternative, simpler observational analyses We now describe three simpler analytic approaches that, unlike ours, include individuals in the analysis only once. Treatment assigned at time zero/eligibility determined at time zero A simpler emulation of the target trial would be identical to our analysis except that individuals would be used only once. That is, we assign individuals who receive a colo- noscopy while meeting the eligibility criteria to the colo- noscopy strategy (with time zero being the time of the colonoscopy), and individuals who did not received a colonoscopy at ﬁrst eligibility to the no colonoscopy group (with time zero being their ﬁrst eligible time during the study period). This approach, which appropriately emulates the target trial, results in 685 unique cases in the screening strategy and 1086 unique cases in the no screening strategy. The risk curves are essentially identical to the ones obtained by using our original approach (Fig. 1). However, the 95% conﬁdence intervals are wider than for our original approach, as expected. The eight-year risk difference is -0.67% (95% CI: -1.03, -0.28) (Table 2). Adjustment for baseline variables do not materially affect this estimate (Supplementary Figure). Treatment assigned at time zero/eligibility determined after time zero A variation of the previous approach is to redeﬁne the no- colonoscopy group to ensure that no individuals in that group ever received a colonoscopy during the follow-up. That is, we assign individuals who receive a colonoscopy while meeting the eligibility criteria to the colonoscopy strategy (with time zero being the time of the colonoscopy), and individuals who did not receive a colonoscopy throughout the entire study periodtotheno-colonoscopygroup(withtimezerobeingtheir ﬁrst eligible time during the study period). Under this analytic approach, there are 685 cases in the screening group, but only 11 in the no-screening group. X. Garcı´a-Albe´niz et al. 123  This approach is biased because in the real world most CRCs are eventually diagnosed via a (screening or diag- nostic) colonoscopy so, by excluding those who received a colonoscopy after time zero, individuals in the no-screen- ing strategy group have little opportunity to have a CRC diagnosed. In fact, this approach excludes approximately 99% of the cases in the no-screening group. As a result of artiﬁcially lowering the CRC risk in the no-screening strategy, screening looks harmful at all times during the follow-up (Fig. 1) and the eight-year risk difference is 1.7% (95% CI: 1.4, 2.1). Adjustment for baseline variables do not materially affect this estimate (Supplementary Figure). Treatment assigned before time zero/eligibility determined at time zero Previously published analyses [8] were based on yet another analytic approach: selecting an arbitrary time zero to ascertain eligibility, e.g., January 1, 2004, and then assigning all eligible individuals to the colonoscopy strategy if they received a colonoscopy in the previous ﬁve years, or to the no-screening strategy otherwise. This approach is subject to selection bias [9] because colonoscopies performed before the assessment of eligibility may affect eligibility. In particular, a colonoscopy that detects CRC or precursor lesions in the previous ﬁve years will result Table 1 Speciﬁcation and emulation of a target trial of screening colonoscopy using real world data from U.S. Medicare 1999–2012 Component Target trial Emulated trial using real world data Aim To estimate the effect of screening colonoscopy on the 8-year risk of CRC in U.S. individuals aged 70–74 years Same Eligibility Persons without gastrointestinal symptoms aged 70–74 years with no history of CRC, and continuously enrolled in Medicare for 5 years with no adenoma, inﬂammatory bowel disease, colectomy, or CRC screening in that period, and who were regular users of preventive services (at least 2 of the following: inﬂuenza vaccine, preventive visit, breast or prostate screening, in the 2 years before enrollment) Same, except CRC history is evaluated in the 5 years before enrollment Treatment strategies 1.

Garcı´a-Albe´niz et al. 123  Discussion Our explicit emulation of a target trial yielded effect esti- mates that are consistent with the expected effect of screening colonoscopy: an initially increased risk due to the diagnosis of subclinical cancers at baseline followed by a decreased risk due to the elimination of cancer precursors during colonoscopy. A simpliﬁed variation of our original approach that does not allow for repeated eligibility resulted in very similar point estimates, but wider 95% conﬁdence intervals. Our target trial emulation respected a basic principle of trial design: both treatment assignment and the determi- nation of eligibility occur simultaneously at time zero [10]. In contrast, observational analyses that violated this basic principle yielded implausible estimates of the effect of screening colonoscopy. The exclusion of post-baseline colonoscopies from the no screening group (similar to commonly used, naı¨ve per-protocol analyses in randomized trials) led to a questionable estimate of continuous harm throughout the entire follow-up. The classiﬁcation into treatment groups before the determination of eligibility led to a logically impossible estimate of beneﬁt that missed the early increased in risk due to the detection of undiagnosed cancers via the screening colonoscopy. The later approach is similar to the one that created confusion about the effect of postmenopausal hormone therapy in observational studies [1, 11]. Note that adjustment for multiple covariates could not correct the bias introduced by the incorrect design of these two observational analyses. These results suggest that the increased complexity and computational demands of our observational analysis were justiﬁed. An explicit emulation of a target trial was able to reproduce the non-monotonic effect estimates and, when combined with multiple eligibility entry points for each individual (who can therefore be considered exposed and unexposed at different times), also reduced the variance of the estimates compared with simpler approaches. An open question is how much the implementation of repeated eligibility reduces the variance of the estimates. It turns out that, in our setting, we can empirically answer this question because we used only 5% of the eligible individuals. After conducting the correct analysis with single eligibility using an increasing proportion of eligible individuals, we found that only after including about 50% of the eligible individuals in the no screening group, the variance of the estimates was close to that of the estimates in the original analysis. That is, allowing the individuals to contribute to multiple emulated trials was the equivalent of increasing the sample size of the unexposed group approximately tenfold. Of course, the effect estimate of our emulation approach might still be biased because of confounding (if individuals assigned to the screening and no screening groups differ with respect to their risk factors for CRC) or selection bias (if, for example, the loss to follow-up was differential across groups). However, these biases seem unlikely to explain our results because adjustment for multiple demographic, clinical, and health care utilization covariates (which are either confounders or proxies for confounders) did not materially affect the estimates. The validity of our approach is also supported by the consistency between the ﬁndings from emulated trials and of actual randomized trials for two other types of screen- ing, for which randomized trial data exist. First, the colo- noscopy effect estimates in our emulated trial were consistent with the estimates from several randomized tri- als of sigmoidoscopy screening (a less invasive procedure than colonoscopy). Second, the effect estimates from an emulated trial of fecal occult blood test (FOBT) effects were consistent with those of FOBT randomized trials [12, 13]. In summary, in this setting with a point intervention, we empirically demonstrated that the lack of synchronization of treatment assignment and eligibility determination at time zero leads to biased estimates, and also that allowing for repeated eligibility increases the statistical efﬁciency of the estimates. The publication of the ﬁndings of several screening colonoscopy randomized trials in the next decade will provide the ultimate test of our approach for studying the comparative effectiveness and safety of health interventions.

We aimed toevaluate the impact of key colonoscopy quality indicators on adenoma detection and preventionof PCCRC in LS. MethodsWe conducted a multicenter study focused on LS carriers without previous colorectal cancerundergoing colonoscopy surveillance (n=893). Incident colorectal neoplasia during surveillanceand quality indicators of all colonoscopies were analyzed. We performed an emulated targettrial comparing the results from first and second surveillance colonoscopies to assess the effectof colonoscopy quality indicators on adenoma detection and PCCRC incidence. Risk analyseswere conducted using a multivariable logistic regression model. ResultsThe 10-year cumulative incidence of adenoma and PCCRC was 60.6% (95%CI;55.5-65.2%)and7.9%(95%CI:5.2-10.6%), respectively.Adequatebowelpreparation(OR=2.07;95%CI:1.06- 4.3)complete colonoscopies (20% vs. 0%; p=.01), and pan-chromoendoscopyuse (OR=2.14; 95%CI:1.15-3.95) were associated withsignificant improvement in adenomadetection). PCCRC risk was significantly lower when colonoscopies were performed in a timeinterval of less than 3-year (OR=0.35; 95%CI: 0.14-0.97). We observed a consistent but notsignificant reduction in PCCRC risk for previous complete examination (OR=0.16; 95%CI: 0.03- 1.28); adequate bowel preparation (OR=0.64; 95%CI:0.17-3.24) or previous use ofhigh- definition colonoscopy(OR=0.37; 95%CI:0.02-2.33). ConclusionsComplete colonoscopies with adequate bowel preparation and chromoendoscopy use areassociated with improved adenoma detection, while surveillance intervals less than 3 years areassociated withreduction of PCCRC incidence. In Lynch syndrome, high-quality colonoscopysurveillanceis of utmost importance for CRC prevention. Journal Pre-proof  5KeywordsColorectal Neoplasms, Lynch syndrome, Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer, HNPCC,hereditary colorectal cancer, colonoscopy quality, colonoscopy.Journal Pre-proof  6Introduction Lynch syndrome (LS) is defined by the presence of a germline pathogenic variant in one of theDNA mismatch repair genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 and 3’ end of EPCAM), and accountsfor up to 3% of all colorectal cancers (CRC) 1,2. This syndrome is characterized by thedevelopment of cancers at an early age(CRC, endometrial and other extracolonic cancers),and is one of the most common hereditary cancer syndromes3. Colonoscopy has been shown to reduce CRC incidence and mortality in LS carriers4. Thedetection and resection of colorectal precursor lesionsis the underlying mechanism throughwhich colonoscopy prevents CRC. Colorectal adenomas arerecognized as the main precursorlesions for CRC in LS, with an accelerated progression (<3 years) of adenoma-carcinomasequence5. Accordingly,surveillance colonoscopy every 1-2 years starting at the age of 25 (35for MSH6 and PMS2 carriers) is recommended by most guidelines6.Post-colonoscopy CRCs (PCCRC), defined by the World Endoscopy Organization as cancersappearing after a colonoscopy in which no cancer is diagnosed, is a significantconcern withrates ofup to9.3% of CRCsin population-based screening programs7,8. In LS, recent studieshave reportedhigh rates of PCCRC with cumulative incidences of up to 45% in MLH1 carriers,35% in MSH2 and 20% in MSH6 carriers at 70 years9 despite colonoscopy surveillance. Thesedatahave put into questionthe preventive benefitof colonoscopy in LS. Colonoscopy is highly dependent on operator skill and subject to quality variability . Adenomascan befrequently missed, with miss rates of 26% for adenomas (95%CI 23%–30%) and 9% foradvanced adenomas (95%CI 4%–16%) in the general population10. Missed lesions are thoughtto be the main cause of PCCRC and together with procedural factors (inadequate examinations,incomplete polyp resection and lack of adherence to surveillance intervals) can explain most ofPCCRC, up to 86.4% in seminal studies11. Some key quality performance indicators forcolonoscopy include complete visualization of the colon with cecal intubation, adequate bowelpreparation, and appropriate surveillance intervals. In LS, high rates of missed adenomas (12%- 74%) have been reported in randomized controlled studies12. However, key quality performanceindicators have not yet been appropriately evaluated in LS cohorts, and therefore theexplanation for the apparently high incidence of PCCRC in LS remains elusive. Journal Pre-proof  7This study aimed to assess surveillance patternsof LS carriersin clinical practice, and toelucidate the potential impact of colonoscopy quality indicators onadenoma detection andprevention of PCCRC.Journal Pre-proof  8Methods ParticipantsWe conducted an observational multicenter cohort study with retrospective collection of data onLS carriers from high-risk cancer clinics. Our study designaimed to : a) describe thesurveillance colonoscopies and outcomes of LS carriers, and b) emulate a randomized trialevaluating the effect of colonoscopy quality indicators on adenoma detection and PCCRCprevention13. From January 2016 to July 2019, 1,940 LS carriers were included from the Epicolon Consortium(22 high-risk gastrointestinal cancer clinics from Spain)2, Catalan Institute of Oncology (ICO)centers and the Amsterdam Universitair Medische Centra, location Academic Medical Centerfrom the Netherlands. The study was approved by the IRB at each center. Information ondemographic and genetic factors, cancer characteristics, and surveillance was retrospectivelycollected until 2016,and prospectively observed data updated until2019. Genetic variantswere reviewed by a panel of experts and individuals were included if a germline pathogenicvariant (class 4 and 5 according to InSiGHT classification guidelines) in one of the mismatchrepair genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 and 3’ end EPCAM deletions) was confirmed. Afterthe inclusion period, a detailed casereview was performed and duplicate cases were identifiedby comparing birthdates, sex, and genetic variants. For this study, we included a cohort of 893 LS carriers without prior CRC diagnosed before or atthe first colonoscopy, regardless history of other LS related cancers, undergoing colonoscopysurveillance. (Figure 1). All carriers had at least 2 colonoscopies and end of follow-up was atthe diagnosis of a PCCRC or at the last colonoscopy. Colonoscopy quality indicators. Quality indicators included: complete visualization of the colon (cecal intubation); bowelpreparation [adequate if the preparation was good or excellent in a quality scale or if BostonBowel Preparation Scale was >2 in all segments)], type of endoscope (high or standarddefinition),andtime-intervalbetweencolonoscopies.Whereastheuseofpan- chromoendoscopy [virtual (Narrow Band Imagining, Fuji Intelligent Chromo Endoscopy, LinkedColour Imaging, I-Scan) or dye-based (Indigo Carmine and Methylene blue)] is not formallyJournal Pre-proof  9considered a quality indicator, it was included since this technique enhances the detection ofcolorectal lesions. Colonoscopies repeated within 6 months due to inadequate preparation,incomplete examination or inspection of a previous polypectomy site, were combinedandassigned the date of the last examination. OutcomesOutcomes were colorectal adenoma and PCCRC detection during surveillance. Adenomaswere categorized according to the risk of progression to cancer in advanced adenomas (>10mm in size, and/or high-grade dysplasia, and/or >25% villous component) and non-advancedadenomas (<10mm with low grade dysplasia and no villous component). Information aboutnumber, location, morphology, and size was collected. PCCRC location, size, stage, andtreatment details were collected. In patients with synchronous PCCRCs, the worst stage atdiagnosis was considered for analysis. Proximal colon was defined as proximal to the splenicflexure (i.e. cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon).Statistical analysesFirst, a descriptive analysis was performed. Percentages were used for categorical data, usingmedian and interquartile range (IQR) for non-normally distributed variables, and mean andstandard deviation (SD) for normally distributed. When information was missing the denominatoraccounted for patients with available data. The adenoma and PCCRC cumulative incidenceswere calculated using Kaplan-Meier method, with 0 time at first colonoscopy. Comparisonsbetween categorical data were performed with Fisher's exact or ANOVA statistics,and forcontinuousdata we used the Student t-test for parametric and U-Mann-Whitney test fornonparametric data. To evaluate the potential effect of colonoscopy quality indicators on adenoma detection andPCCRC incidence, we emulated a target trial13.The principle of an emulated target trial is toapproximate as closely as possible the design of an unfeasible randomized control trial.. Theaim was to analyze: a) the association between colonoscopy quality indicators, as well as use ofpan-chromoendoscopy, and the detection of adenomas, and b) the association betweencolonoscopy quality indicators and PCCRC incidence at subsequent colonoscopy. The trialmust identifyan eligible population (LS carriers without a prior history of CRC who underwentJournal Pre-proof  10 at least 2 colonoscopies), a clear definition of time zero (first surveillance colonoscopy) and synchronization of an intervention assignment (colonoscopy quality indicators from the firstsurveillance colonoscopy). The protocol is detailed in Supplementary Table 1. This approachcompares two interventions (i.e. high- and low-quality parameters) simulating a randomassignment by adjusting for baseline covariates (i.e. sex, age at first colonoscopy, MMR gene,and hospital- specific fixed effects). As the potential combinations of high- and low- qualityfeatures of colonoscopy surveillance increase exponentially with longerfollow-up , we limitedthis analysis to the first and second surveillance colonoscopies. This approach also allowedreducing surveillance, detection and treatment biases (i.e. different follow-up times, age atcolonoscopy, and higher detection due to increased surveillance). Additionally, patients withprevious CRC were excluded. Risk analyses were conducted using a multivariable logisticregression model. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs for all the quality measures were computedboth with and without controlling for confounders.Finally, we performed an exploratory analysis to assess risk-factors associated with PCCRC.We compared characteristics between patients with and without PCCRC and between carrierswho underwent surveillance under different quality standards by logistic regression analysis. All calculations were performed with SPSS version 25 (SPSS) and R project version: 3.5.2. Alltests were 2-sided, and a P value of less than .05 was considered statistically significant. Journal Pre-proof  11 Results We included 893 LS without prior history of CRC carriers undergoing colonoscopy surveillance.The demographic characteristics are presented in Table 1.Colonoscopy quality indicators per procedureA total of 4,177 colonoscopies from the 893 carriers were reviewed (Supplementary Table 2).Quality indicators of the surveillance colonoscopies were as follows: 98.4% (4,050/4,115) werecomplete examinations, 89.2% (3,244/3,721) had adequate bowel preparation, 32.5%(1,095/3,371) were performed with high-definition colonoscopes andpan-chromoendoscopywas performed in 19.6% (688/3,517). Examinations were performed within 2 and 3 years in62.8% (2,622/3,284) and 78.6% (3,066/3,284) of cases, respectively. Most colonoscopies (83%;3,465/4,177) were performed from 2010 onwards and hadbetter quality parameters comparedto those performed before 2010 (p<0.05 for all comparisons). Colonoscopy quality indicators per LS carrierThe median age at first colonoscopy was 41 years [Interquartile rang (IQR) 32-50], and medianfollow-up was 5.3 years (IQR 2–8). Patients underwent a median of 4 colonoscopies (IQR 3-6)with median interval per patient of 16.6 months (IQR 12.7 – 24.7) (Table 1). The cecum in was reached in all procedures in 89.2% (797) carriers,bowel preparation wasadequate for all colonoscopies in 50.1% (447),high-definition colonoscopes were used eachtime in 12.3% (110)and pan-chromoendoscopy was performed at every examination in4.6%(41).(Supplementary Table 3). About half (50.7% (453)) carriers had all their examinationsperformed within 2 years, and 78.5% (701) within 3 years. When we combined qualityindicators, only 28.2% (252) carriers had all their colonoscopies be complete, with adequatepreparation, and with all time-intervals within 2 years. This proportion was 40.4% (361) for 3- year intervals. Colorectal neoplasia in LS carriersDuring surveillance 36.5% (326) carriers had normal colonoscopies. The most advanced lesionwas a non-advanced adenoma in 29.3% (262), an advanced adenoma in 13.4% (120) and aPCCRC in 5.4% (48) carriers (50 cancers). Journal Pre-proof  12 An advanced adenoma was detected in 15% (134) carriers (Supplementary Table 4). In brief,10% (89) of carriers hadadenomas >10 mm; 8.2% (73) with high-grade dysplasia; and 7.3%(66) with villous component. Interestingly, in 35% (26) of carriers with high-grade dysplasia, theadenomaswere <10mm in size.The 10-year cumulative incidence of non-advanced andadvanced adenomas was 54.4% (95%CI; 49.2-58.5%) and 20.4% (95%CI; 16.7-24%),respectively (Figure 2). The distribution of PCCRC by MMR gene was as follows: 35.4%(17) MLH1, 50% (24) MSH2,12.5% (6) MSH6 and 2.1% (1)PMS2, and PCCRC wasmore frequent in MLH1/MSH2 vsMSH6/PMS2 carriers (p=.006) (Supplementary Table 5). Median age at diagnosis was 51years (IQR 44-58.8). Most of the cancers (34/50; 68%) were proximal. Regarding tumor staging,76% (34) patients were diagnosed in early stages (TNM stage I-II), 24% (11) in stage III and nostage IV cancers were found (Supplementary Table 6). The 10-year cumulative incidence ofPCCRC was 7.9% (95%CI; 5.2-10.6%) (Figure 2). Impact of colonoscopy quality indicators on adenoma detection For this analysis we focused on the adenoma detection per quality indicator at first colonoscopy.(Table 2 and Figure 3A). Of all carriers, 19.8% (177) were diagnosed with at least oneadenoma, of which 14.6% (130) had non-advanced adenoma and 7.4% (66) hadadvancedadenoma [4.5% (40) >10mm in size; 4.5% (40) with high-grade dysplasia; and 4% (36) withvillous component]. Adequate bowel preparation (OR=2.07; 95%CI 1.06–4.3) and completenessof the procedure (20% of complete colonoscopies revealed adenomas vs. 0% of incompleteones; p=.01) were associated with significantly improved adenoma detection. . In the smallproportion where pan-chromoendoscopy was performed, adenoma detection was also improved(OR=2.14; 95%CI 1.15–3.95). In the case of non-advanced adenomas, all quality indicatorswere associated with improved detection, including the use of high-definition endoscopes(OR=2.18; 95%CI 1.13–4.2). Conversely, for advanced adenomas, no association betweenquality indicators and detection was found. For adenomas <1 cm, adequate preparation(OR=2.63; 95%CI 1.26–6.07), completeness (16.5% vs 0%, p=.04), high-definition scopes(OR=1.99; 95%CI 1.05–3.76) and pan-chromoendoscopy (OR=2.47; 95%CI 1.31–4.63), wereassociated with increased detection. No association was found for adenomas >1 cm. Finally,Journal Pre-proof  13 21% (37/177) of carriers had flat adenomas, withsignificantly higher detectionfor high- definition scopes (OR=3.04; 95%CI 1.13-8.65) and pan-chromoendoscopy (OR=6.44; 95% CI2.29–9.59). Impact of colonoscopy quality indicators on PCCRC preventionWe then evaluated the incidence of PCCRC at the second colonoscopy per individual qualityindicator from the first colonoscopy (Table 2; Figure 3B). In 2.6% (23) of patients a PCCRCwas detected at the second colonoscopy. PCCRC risk was significantly lower whencolonoscopies were performed in a less than 3-year interval (OR=0.35; 95%CI 0.14-0.97). Forthe other quality indicators we observed a non-statistically significant reduction in PCCRC risk:previous complete examination (OR=0.16; 95%CI 0.03-1.28); previously adequate bowelpreparation (OR=0.64; 95%CI 0.17-3.24), and previous use of a high definition scope(OR=0.37; 95%CI 0.02-2.33). Performing pan-chromoendoscopy in the previous colonoscopywas not associated with PCCRC (OR=0.66; 95% CI 0.03–4.20). Factors associated with PCCRC Independent risk factors for PCCRC were an advanced adenoma at any colonoscopy(OR=2.42; 95%CI 1.22-4.8; p=.01) and being MLH1 or MSH2 carrier (OR=2.45; 95%CI 1.06- 5.62; p=.04) (Supplementary Table 7). Interestingly, within the components of the definition ofadvanced adenoma, only the presence of high-grade dysplasia remained as an independentrisk factor for PCCRC (OR=4.55: 95%CI 1.67-12.22 p=.003). Regarding the surveillanceprogram, performing all colonoscopies with a >3-year interval (OR=5.17; 95%CI 2.18-12.25;p<.001) and the use of standard definition scopes (OR=2.77; 95%CI 1.44-5.31; p=.002) in allprocedures were associated with PCCRC; whereas performing only complete colonoscopieswas a protective factor (OR=0.24; 95%CI 0.11-0.5; p<.001).Finally, we compared the PCCRC-risk among LS carriers without prior history of CRC that hadundergone all colonoscopies fulfilling the combination (complete, adequately prepared and <3years interval) of quality indicators (Supplementary Table 8). The PCCRC-risk was significantlylower in carriers receiving high-quality surveillance (i.e. 2.8 vs. 7.1%, p<.001). Journal Pre-proof  14 DiscussionThis study shows that the quality of colonoscopy surveillance has a major impact on CRCprevention in LS. Our data indicate that in LScarriers without prior history of CRC, surveillancequalityis generally poor , with only 28% of patients with complete colonoscopies , adequate preparation, andless than 2-year intervals 14. Moreover, we found a correlation betweencolonoscopy quality indicators and the detection of adenomas, and an emulated target trialshowed an inverse association between colonoscopy quality indicators and the risk of PCCRCin the subsequent colonoscopy.Adenoma detection and removal is the cornerstone of CRC prevention. However, colonoscopyis a highly operator-dependent procedure, with a wide variability in detection and resection oflesions, as observed inaverage-risk population studies 15. For this reason, several qualityindicators have been proposedto control procedural factors (i.e. complete visualization of thecolon, bowel preparation, use of high definition scopes) and endoscopist skill(i.e. adenomadetection rate) 16,17. In LS, small and retrospective studies, withindirect data on colonoscopyquality, revealed that in a meaningful proportion of LS carriers minimum quality standards werenot fulfilled 6,18–20. Moreover, in an uncontrolled study, Perrod et al. showed that the monitoringof quality parameters in LS surveillance program was associated with an improvement in qualityparameters and a reduction in PCCRC incidence18. However, recent studies have reported highcumulative incidence of PCCRC in LS carriers under endoscopic surveillance, withoutconsidering the potential impact of quality of colonoscopy surveillance 6,9,19. Thishas led to a hypothesis that PCCRC in LS arises from a sub-epithelial endoscopically invisible lesion thatprogresses directly to CRC6,19,21. Direct evidence regarding the existence of such lesionsremains elusive. However, adenomas in LS are more likely to have a flat morphology (alsocalled non-polypoid) and be located in the proximal colon 5,22.These features makes theirrecognition and endoscopic resection more challenging, especially if the colonoscopy isincomplete or if bowel preparation is inadequate. Our results support that quality of colonoscopyin LS is directly associated with adenoma detection and inversely linked to subsequent CRCdevelopment. Fortunately, in the general population, improvement of colonoscopy qualityindicators leads to a reduction in CRC incidence and mortality 23, and in parallel with ourfindings, optimizing quality indicators in LS surveillance should improve CRC prevention.Journal Pre-proof  15 Further prospective studies of PCCRC incidence in LS accounting for colonoscopy qualityparameters in canclarify the contribution of the hypotheticalsub-epithelial endoscopicallyinvisible lesion pathway in LS. An interesting finding is that quality indicators were associated with an increased detection ofnon-advanced adenomas. Since the majority of advanced adenomas in our cohort were >10mm, and the detection of large adenomas (>1 cm) is not as influenced by quality factors as for small ones10, these results were not unexpected. However, in 35% of patients with high-gradedysplasia, in the adenomas were <10 mm in size. Although in the general population smalladenomas are associated with a low risk of malignant transformation, our results support thateven non-advanced adenomas might constitute a high-risk lesion in LS due to the potential foraccelerated carcinogenesis. . Accordingly, detecting and completely resecting every adenoma(including those <10 mm) should be the goal of endoscopic surveillance in LS. Regarding therole of chromoendoscopy in LS, even thoughwe have recently demonstrated that high- definition white-light endoscopy is not inferior to pancolonic chromoendoscopy if performed byexperienced and trainedendoscopists12, it should be considered especially in non-dedicatedcenters as stated in the recent ESGE guidelines14. Besides, an indirect clinical implication of ourresults is that surveillance colonoscopies in LS not fulfilling quality indicators should be repeatedin a short period of time14.Our results indicate that in LS carriers without prior history of CRC, the 10-year cumulativeincidence of PCCRC is up to 8%, similar to recent studies19,24. We observed a 65% reduction inPCCRC risk when colonoscopies had been performed in <3 years, suggesting that an interval ofat least 2 years may be enough in most cases. Moreover, PCCRC in carriers complying withcurrent guidelines was extremely low (1.2%), which supports the importance of performing high- quality surveillance. Furthermore, being a MLH1 or MSH2 carrier and developing an advancedadenoma during surveillance were independent predictors of PCCRC, suggesting that thesefactors could be used to personalize surveillance in LS 6,19. Further prospective studies need tobe conducted to validate the efficacy and safety of risk-based surveillance strategies.This study has several strengths. First, it is a multi-centerstudy with systematic and thorough review of all medical recordsin LS carriers allowing us toanalyze quality indicators. Second,Journal Pre-proof  16 we used a study design emulating a target trial to assess the effect of quality on diagnosis andprevention of colorectal neoplasia, controlling for many potential biases associated with CRCrisk, including treatment and time bias. However, the study does have limitations. First, althoughdata were prospectively collected at each center, the retrospective design cannot establishcausality.Second, the low number of PCCRCs in the second colonoscopy may have precludeddetecting statistical significance of the effect of quality on its prevention. However, we observeda consistent signal for all quality indicators supported by the exploratory analysis. Third, theeffect of adenoma detection rate, as the most relevant and validated colonoscopy qualityindicator, could not be assessed as the information was not available for the majority of thecenters. Fourth, the effect of adenoma resection and its potential impact on PCCRCdevelopment in the same colonic segment could not be analyzed, as the information was notsystematically collected. Finally, our results apply only to LS carriers without a prior history ofCRC. However, as a proof of concept study describing the effect of colonoscopy qualityindicators on PCCRC incidence, the reason to focus on this population was to reduce thepotential for confoundingthat may influence CRC risk in patients with a previous CRC. In conclusion, this is the first study that thoroughly assessed the impact of colonoscopy qualityindicators in LS. Our results provide robust evidence to optimize colonoscopy surveillance in LScarriers in order to improve CRC prevention. High-quality colonoscopy in LS is of utmostimportance to be effective, and this includes completeness, adequate bowel preparation, use ofhigh definition endoscopes and surveillance intervals of less than 3-year intervals.Journal Pre-proof  17 References1.

FINDINGS In this cohort study of 893 Lynch syndrome carriers without previous colorectal cancer, 48 (5%)developed a PCCRC during surveillance. High quality of colonoscopy surveillance is associatedwith a significantly increase in adenoma detection and a decrease in PCCRC incidence.IMPLICATIONS FOR PATIENT CARELynch syndrome carriers should undergo colonoscopies in less than 3-year intervals, withcomplete examinations, adequate bowel preparation and with high definition scopes to preventpost-colonoscopy colorectal cancer.

This study was to investigate whether early endocrine outcomes in patients withGH-secreting pituitary adenoma underwent endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery would be better than thoseoperated by microscopic surgery.Methods: An acromegaly database collected from 2010 to 2019 in a single institution was used to emulate arandomized trial. Adult patients operated by a transsphenoidal approach using either endoscope or microscopewere included. The primary outcome was endocrine remission based on insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) atsix-month follow-up after surgery. We used inverse probability weighting to construct a pseudo population fromwhich the treatment effect was estimated.Results: In the original cohort, 1118 patients underwent transsphenoidal surgery (424 with an endoscopicapproach and 694 with a microscopic approach). Patients treated with endoscopic surgery were more likely to bepreviously surgical treated and to have an invasive tumor than patients who underwent microscopic surgery. Inthe pseudo population, the proportion of endocrine remission was 54.9% in the endoscopic group and 42.0% inthe microscopic group (odds ratio, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.27–2.23). This finding was consistent and robust acrossseveral sensitivity analyses.Conclusions: Among patients with growth hormone secreting pituitary adenoma who underwent transsphenoidalsurgery, endoscopic surgery was associated with higher early endocrine remission than microscopic surgery.1. IntroductionAcromegaly is usually caused by a somatotroph pituitary adenomathat secretes excessive growth hormone (GH) and associated withincreased circulating insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Trans- sphenoidal surgery remains one of the primary treatment options inpatients with GH-secreting pituitary adenoma, and endocrine controlwas the ultimate goal for these patients [1,2]. The microscopic approachwas adopted since the 1970s until the recent decade [3] - the applicationof endoscope in the surgical resection of pituitary adenomas has gainedconsiderable popularity [4,5].Threecomparativeretrospectivestudies[6–8]andtwometa-analyses [9,10] showed a similar endocrine remission ratecomparing endoscopic approach and microscopic approach in* Correspondence to: Department of Neurosurgery, Huashan Hospital, Shanghai Medical School, Fudan University, Shanghai, ChinaE-mail addresses: eamns@hotmail.com (Y.

While on the other hand, higher resection rate inendoscopic surgery was observed in some well-designed studies [11,12].Is there no difference between the two approaches or previous studieswere underpowered? The best way to compare the clinical outcomesafter endoscopic approach versus microscopic approach in patients withGH-secreting pituitary adenoma is through a randomized clinical trial(Table 1). In the circumstances where acromegaly is a rare disease (withan incidence of 2–11 cases per million person-years) [13] and theassumed effect difference between the two treatments was small, toperform a randomized trial is neither actual nor practical.Causal inference from the observational database can be viewed asan attempt to emulate a randomized experiment - the targeted trial - thatwould answer the question of interest [14]. We hypothesized that earlyendocrine outcomes in patients with GH-secreting pituitary adenomaunderwent endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery would be better thanthose operated by microscopic surgery. In this emulated trial, we testthis question of interest using our observational database collected from2010 after rigorous statistical methods adjusting for differences in pa- tient characteristics.2. Methods2.1. Study populationAll the patients with GH-secreting pituitary adenoma admitted to ourinstitution from 2010 to 2019 were enrolled. The diagnosis of acro- megaly was established based on symptoms and signs at presentation,evidence of a pituitary adenoma on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)of the pituitary fossa and high serum concentrations of GH or IGF-1. Thisstudy was approved by the Institutional Review Board and patients wereconsented before their clinical data was logged into the database.2.2. Eligibility criteriaOur analyses included all the adult individuals operated by a trans- sphenoidal approach using either an endoscope or a microscope. Theseeligibility criteria were as similar as possible to those of the targetedtrials (Table 1).2.3. Treatment arms and follow-upMultiple surgeons performed the surgeries. Surgeries in the micro- scopic arm were based on the standard microscopic transseptalapproach advised by Hardy and Vezina [3]. Surgeries in the endoscopicarm were performed using a 4-hand bi-nostril technique [15]. Surgeons’experience were documented as annual pituitary operation volume(categorized as less than 25 operations/year, 25–100 operations/year,or more than 100 operations/year). Clinical and laboratory assessmentswere conducted at the pre-operative visit, three months and six monthsafter the initiation of treatment. The assessments consisted of historytaking; physical examination; MRI; measurement of random serum GHor serum GH during an oral glucose tolerance test, and measurement ofserum IGF-1. The tumor volume was estimated using the equation: 0.5 *length * height * width, where either length, height, or width was thelargest dimension indicated on the MRI. Cavernous sinus invasion wasevaluated using the Knosp classification.2.4. Serum assaysGH was measured using the 2-site chemiluminescent immunometricassay AutoDELFIA hGH (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences,Wallac Oy, Finland) or Elecsys hGH (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). IGF-1 was measured using an Immulite 2000 enzyme-labeled chemilumi- nescent assay (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostic, Surrey, UK). Details ofthe assay variation and sensitivity are provided in the SupplementaryAppendix. We normalized IGF-1 level as the ratio between the measuredlevel and the upper limit of normal stratified by age and gender (IGF-1index).2.5. OutcomesThe primary outcome was endocrine remission based on IGF-1 (IGF-1 index < 1) at six-months follow-up after surgery. Secondary outcomesinclude endocrine remission based on GH level (nadir GH < 0.4 ug/Lduring an oral glucose tolerance test, and/or random GH < 1.0 ug/L[16]), endocrine remission based both GH and IGF-1 level (IGF-1 index< 1 and nadir GH < 0.4 ug/L during an oral glucose tolerance test, orIGF-1 index < 1 and random GH < 1.0 ug/L), gross-total resection basedTable 1Design of the targeted randomized trial and our emulated trial.Targeted Randomized TrialEmulated TrialAimTo compare the effectiveness of endoscopic versus microscopictranssphenoidal surgery for growth hormone secreting pituitary adenoma.Same.Study population andeligibility criteriaPatients with growth hormone secreting pituitary adenoma admitted to asingle institution.Inclusion criteria: ● Age >= 18 years old; ● Symptomatic with elevated IGF-1 or GH; ● Pituitary adenoma on MRI;Exclusion Criteria: ● Not recommend for treatment via transsphenoidal approach.Same.

Statistical analysisFor the primary efficacy analysis, we calculated that the inclusion of1042 patients would provide the targeted trial with 90% power to testthe superiority of endoscopic versus microscopic approach. We onlyestimated the per-protocol effect (Table 1). To account for bias andconfounding between two arms (e.g., patients with invasive tumors weremore likely to have an endoscopic surgery), we used inverse probabilityweighting (IPW) to construct a pseudo population who differed from theoriginal cohort but were similar concerning other measured character- istics [17,18]. The bias and confounder can be eliminated by giving eachindividual’s data a weight inversely proportional to their probability ofselection. This analysis can be thought of as creating a study with nodifferential selection.The weight was the product of two parts: the inverse probability oftreating (IPTW) and the inverse probability of censoring (IPCW). Tocalculate IPTW, we estimated each patient’s propensity to undergoendoscopic surgery using a logistic regression model. Similarly, tocalculate IPCW, we estimated each patient’s propensity of being fol- lowed up using another logistic regression model. Both models includedage, gender, body mass index, previous treatment histories, baselineIGF-1 and GH, tumor volume, tumor invasion, and surgeons’ experienceas covariates. We assigned patients who underwent endoscopic surgerya weight of 1/(propensity to treat) and those who underwent micro- scopic surgery a weight of 1/(1 – propensity to treat). Similarly, weassigned patients who were followed up a weight of 1/(propensity to beuncensored) and those who were censored a weight of 1/(1 – propensityto be uncensored). We used stabilized weights to reduce the variabilityand truncated the weights at 99% to avoid positivity violation. Weassessed balance among covariates using standardized mean differencesin the pseudo population; a difference of 10% or less was considered toindicate a well-balanced result [19].We used a similar approach to perform analyses in secondary out- comes. We further tested the effect size in prespecified subgroups (age,gender, medical history, and Knosp grade) after refitting separate in- verse probability weighted models.We performed several sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness ofour results. First, we used logistic regression on only complete cases withfollow-up to estimate the treatment effect [20]. Second, we used mul- tiple imputation for the unmeasured follow-up data [21]. This processFig. 1. Study population. N. Qiao et al. Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery 207 (2021) 106781 4 was repeated 100 times to produce many datasets with imputed data.We used 1:1 propensity score matching on each dataset to generate thetreatment effect estimation, and then, the point and variance estimationwere summarized. Third, we repeated the analysis restricted in patientsthat were performed by experienced surgeons and in patients that wereperformed within recent four years (when endoscopic surgeries wereincreasingly adopted). Finally, we estimated the potential effect of un- observed confounders, using an array-approach analysis [22].Details of the sensitivity analyses and reporting checklist accordingto STROBE statement are provided in the Supplementary Appendix. Allstatistical analyses were completed by R software version 3.4.2.3. ResultsDuring the 2010–2019 period, 1118 patients with GH-secreting pi- tuitary adenoma who met the inclusion criteria were included (Fig. 1); ofthese patients, 424 (38.6%) underwent endoscopic surgery. Table 2summarizes clinical, endocrine, and radiological characteristics of thestudy population before and after inverse probability weighting. Pa- tients who underwent endoscopic surgery were more likely to be pre- viously surgical treated (14.4% versus 8.9%), to present cavernous sinusinvasion (43.2% versus 31.0%) and to harbor clivus invasion (9.7%versus 4.9%) than patients who underwent microscopic surgery. Previ- ous somatostatin analogue treatment was more frequent in patients whounderwent microscopic surgery. The treatment probabilities withinpatients underwent endoscopic surgery and microscopic surgery weredepicted in Fig. 2. The covariates were well balanced in the pseudocohort after inverse probability weighting, with all the standardizedmean differences less than 10%.Endocrine remission was achieved in 179/345 patients (51.9%)underwent endoscopic surgery and in 195/466 patients (41.8%) un- derwent microscopic surgery. In the pseudo population, the proportionof remission was 54.9% in the endoscopic group and 42.0% in themicroscopic group, which corresponded to 68% higher odds to be sur- gically cured (odds ratio, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.27–2.23, p < 0.001) usingendoscopic technique than using microscopic technique (Table 3).For secondary outcomes (Table 3), after inverse probabilityweighting, we found that patients who underwent endoscopic surgeryhad higher odds to those underwent microscopic surgery in terms ofendocrine remission based on GH (odds ratio, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.27–2.19,p < 0.001), endocrine remission based on both GH and IGF-1 (oddsratio, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.34–2.27, p < 0.001). We observed less intra- operative cerebrospinal fluid leakage (odds ratio 0.72; 95% CI,0.55–0.94, p < 0.001) and less transient hypocortisolemia (odds ratio0.49; 95% CI, 0.31–0.80, p < 0.001) in the endoscopic group. The twoarms had similar proportions of gross total resection, similar proportionsof transient hypothyroidism and similar length of stay after surgery.In exploratory subgroup analyses, the higher odds to be surgicallycured that was associated with endoscopic surgery than with micro- scopic surgery was evident across patients with different age, withdifferent gender, with different treatment history and with differentKnosp grade (Fig. 3).In sensitivity analyses, logistic regression after the exclusion of pa- tients who were censored did not alter our findings substantially (oddsratio, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.27–2.24). 1:1 propensity score matching aftermultiple imputation provided similar results (odds ratio, 1.73; 95% CI,1.45–2.12, Supplementary Table S1). Alternative analytic strategiesyielded consistent results, including analysis restricted in the experi- enced surgeons (odds ratio, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.34–2.44) and analysisrestricted in the recent four years (odds ratio, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.40–2.84).Finally, we observed that an unmeasured confounder would have to bevery strongly associated with remission and highly imbalanced betweenendoscopic and microscopic groups (i.e., odds ratio > 2.50 with 40%difference in prevalence) to fully negate the result.4. DiscussionThis real-world study suggests that endoscopic surgery was associ- ated with a higher likelihood of early endocrine remission than micro- scopic surgery among patients who underwent transsphenoidalresection for GH-secreting pituitary adenoma. This finding was consis- tent and robust across several sensitivity analyses.In the original cohort, patients who underwent endoscopic surgerywould be predicted to have a lower remission rate than those whoTable 2Characteristics of patients who underwent transsphenoidal surgery for GH-secreting pituitary adenoma before and after IPW.Cohort before IPWCohort after IPWMicroscopic (N = 694)Endoscopic (N = 424)Standardized MeanDifferenceMicroscopic (N = 672)Endoscopic (N = 425)Standardized MeanDifferenceAge44.4 (11.8)44.3 (12.7) 0.00844.2 (11.8)44.1 (12.6) 0.023Male334 (48.1%)185 (43.6%) 0.090318 (47.3%)196 (46.1%) 0.026Body mass index25.4 (3.4)25.4 (3.7) 0.00025.5 (3.4)25.4 (3.7) 0.015Symptom duration(years)4.0 [2.0, 8.0]3.0 [1.0, 8.0] 0.0124.0 [2.0, 8.0]3.0 [1.0, 7.0] 0.047Treatment history Radiotherapy16 (2.3%)11 (2.6%) 0.01916 (2.4%)10 (2.4%) 0.005Surgery62 (8.9%)61 (14.4%) 0.17170 (10.4%)42 (9.9%) 0.018Medication282 (40.6%)119 (28.1%) 0.267231 (34.4%)148 (34.8%) 0.007Surgical experience 0.185 0.035<25 cases/year31 (4.5%)9 (2.1%)24 (3.6%)13 (3.1%)25–100 cases/year69 (9.9%)28 (6.6%)54 (8.0%)37 (8.7%)>100 cases/year594 (85.6%)387 (91.3%)594 (88.4%)375 (88.2%)Baseline endocrinology and radiological characteristics Growth hormone (ug/l)10.9 [4.1, 24.9]10.4 [4.9, 20.9] 0.20410.0 [3.8, 23.4]11.5 [5.1, 28.2] 0.038IGF-1index (ULN)2.6 (1.0)2.5 (0.9) 0.0742.5 (0.9)2.5 (0.9) 0.001Tumor volume (cm3)1.0 [0.5, 4.0]1.0 [0.4, 3.6] 0.0430.9 [0.5, 4.0]0.9 [0.4, 3.5] 0.041Knosp grade 0.254 0.0120-II479 (69.0%)241 (56.8%)449 (66.8%)281 (66.1%)III-IV215 (31.0%)183 (43.2%)223 (33.2%)144 (33.9%)Cystic change82 (11.8%)37 (8.7%) 0.10267 (10.0%)41 (9.6%) 0.015Clivus invasion34 (4.9%)41 (9.7%) 0.18441 (6.1%)30 (7.1%) 0.004IPW: inversed probability weighting; SMD: standardized mean difference; IGF-1: insulin-like growth factor 1; ULN: upper limit of normalContinuous variables with normal distribution were presented with mean and standard deviation, continuous variables without normal distribution were presentedwith median and interquartile range and categorical variables were presented with count and percentage.N. Qiao et al. Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery 207 (2021) 106781 5 underwent microscopic surgery based on their higher proportions ofsurgical history and invasive tumors [5,23]. Inverse probabilityweighting or propensity score matching were two modern statisticalmethods for selection bias adjustment [18,24]. The validity of these twomethods to adjust confounding were proved by many non-randomizedstudies [33,34]. In this study, all the measured variables werebalanced after inverse probability weighting, suggesting the similarity(exchangeability) of the two group in the pseudo population. Theadjusted odds ratio was larger than the crude odds ratio after takingmore invasive tumors in the endoscopic group into account. Theadvantage of endoscopic surgery over microscopic surgery can beexplained by higher gross total resection rate endorsed by a panoramicsurgical view with increased illumination of the anatomic structures anda close-up visual examination of the suspected tumor [28,30]. Thedifferently angled optic can be used to make it possible to reach thesuprasellar region as well as lateral extensions [25,26,31,32]. Moreover,Fig. 2.

Qiao et al. Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery 207 (2021) 106781 6 it was reported that higher remission rate was associated with pseudo- capsular dissection technique and resection of cavernous sinus internalwall [4,29], which was more frequently applied in our endoscopicsurgeries.During the early study period (before 2016), endoscope was limitedin our center such that only one endoscopic surgery can be performedevery day, and patients were more likely to undergo microscopic sur- geries in general. In recent years, the volume of endoscopic surgeriesincreased due to more available endoscope devices. Patients with aninvasive tumor were more likely to be submitted to endoscopic surgery,especially in recent years, when microscopic surgeries were chosenmainly in those easy cases. As a result, patients underwent microscopicsurgeries should have a higher remission rate. However, we observed alower remission rate in the microscopic group than in endoscopic groupboth in the crude analysis and the adjusted analysis. In our sensitiveanalysis restricted in those cases performed during 2016–2019, thetreatment effect was similar as the main analysis. We included surgeriesperformed by multiple surgeons to make our emulated trial as similar aspossible to the targeted trial. All the surgeons can perform either type ofsurgeries. Ideally, a multicenter randomized trial involving multiplesurgeons was preferred. We further used annual pituitary operationvolume as the surrogate for surgeons’ experience.We used six-month for our outcome assessment because nearly halfof the patients had medically treated before surgeries. Using a shorterfollow-up period may be compromised by the carry-over effect of thelong-acting somatostatin analogues [27]. After six months, patientswithout remission were submitted for further medical or radiologicaltherapies.Our findings differ from those of earlier retrospective studies [6–8]that concluded endoscopic surgery were comparable with microscopicsurgery in treating GH-secreting pituitary adenoma. However, previousstudies were considerably smaller than the present study and did notconsider differences in baseline characteristics. For example, Hussein etal [6]. did not observe the advantage of endoscopic surgery in 65acromegalic patients, while the rate of cavernous sinus invasion washigher in the endoscopic group. Similar, Starke et al [8]. only observedslightly higher remission rate of endoscopic surgery in 72 patients. Thepooled remission rate was also higher in endoscopic surgery than inmicroscopic surgery from a recent meta-analysis (58.9% versus 54.8%)[10]. The odds ratios that these studies observed were in the same di- rection with that of ours, but they were underpowered to detect aclinically meaningful difference due to small sample size or highheterogeneity.Several advantages in this study include a large sample size (covered8–50 million population according to the incidence), rigorous statisticalanalysis (adjusted for both confounding by indication and by censoring)and robust results. An important limitation of the present study is theexistence of unmeasured confounding and thus it was not the substitu- tion of well conducted randomized clinical trials. For example, patients’or surgeons’ preference was one potential unmeasured confounding andsurgeons’ experience may improve during the study period. However,our sensitivity analyses indicate that an unobserved confounder wouldneed to both have a strong association with endocrine remission and behighly imbalanced between endoscopic and microscopic group to fullynegate the result. Another limitation of this study is the absence of in- formation on further treatment after six-month follow-up or recurrencein our database. We did not have enough power in secondary outcomes,the increased risk of intraoperative cerebral fluid leakage and increasedrisk of transient hypocortisolemia in microscopic group merit cautiousinterpretation. All the tumors resected were submitted for histopatho- logical examination and all the tumors were positive stained for growthhormone. Granular pattern and Pit-1 staining were only available after2017 in our center and this information was not included. Finally, ourfindings may not generalize to patients who were treated in other set- tings with respect to geographic region, study period, treating surgeons,and measurement of outcomes.5.

Super learning to hedge against incorrect inference from arbitrary parametric assumptions in marginal structural modeling Romain Neugebauera,*, Bruce Firemana, Jason A. Royb, Marsha A.

Inferences from hypothetical randomized trials may however be emulated with marginal structural modeling (MSM) using observational data, but success in adjusting for time-dependent confounding and selection bias typically relies on parametric modeling assumptions. If these as- sumptions are violated, inferences from MSM may be inaccurate. In this article, we motivate the application of a data-adaptive estimation approach called super learning (SL) to avoid reliance on arbitrary parametric assumptions in CER. Study Design and Setting: Using the electronic health records data from adults with new-onset type 2 diabetes, we implemented MSM with inverse probability weighting (IPW) estimation to evaluate the effect of three oral antidiabetic therapies on the worsening of glomer- ular ﬁltration rate. Results: Inferences from IPW estimation were noticeably sensitive to the parametric assumptions about the associations between both the exposure and censoring processes and the main suspected source of confounding, that is, time-dependent measurements of hemoglobin A1c. SL was successfully implemented to harness ﬂexible confounding and selection bias adjustment from existing machine learning algorithms. Conclusion: Erroneous IPW inference about clinical effectiveness because of arbitrary and incorrect modeling decisions may be avoided with SL. � 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Introduction In 2006, the American Diabetes Association changed its recommendations for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The long-standing recommenda- tion to begin pharmacotherapy only after a trial of lifestyle modiﬁcation that failed to lower A1c to !7% was replaced with the new guideline for immediate prescription of met- formin at detection of diabetes, regardless of A1c level. Au- thors of the new recommendation indicated that it reﬂects consensus rather than solid evidence. In addition, adverse events linked to the use of thiazoli- dinediones [1] and inhaled insulin raised concerns over the long-term safety and effectiveness of agents used to control glycemia in T2DM patients. Although most experts inter- pret existing data as strongly supporting the safety and ef- fectiveness of metformin, there is less conﬁdence in the long-term safety and effectiveness of sulfonylurea and the use of metformin and sulfonylurea in combination. Using the electronic health records (EHRs) from patients of four sites of the HMO Research Network (HMORN) Consortium [2], we assembled a large retrospective cohort study of adults with new-onset T2DM to evaluate the effect of immediate vs. delayed initial monotherapy or bitherapy with metformin and sulfonylurea on the risk of several clin- ical outcomes. We investigated these effects using marginal structural modeling (MSM) based on inverse probability Conﬂict of interest/ﬁnancial disclosure: G.A.N. received research sup- port from AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck & Co, and Takeda Phar- maceuticals America. * Corresponding author.

What this adds to what was known? � Super learning (SL) can successfully harness ﬂex- ible confounding and selection bias adjustment from existing machine learning algorithms.

Here, our principal goal is twofold: (1) to illustrate the potential for incorrect inference resulting from inadequate parametric adjustment for confounding and informative censoring using MSM in comparative effectiveness re- search (CER) and (2) to illustrate the practical effect of and motivation for data-adaptive estimation with super learning (SL) in MSM. SL is a prediction algorithm, grounded in theoretical results, that builds an optimal weighted combination of predictors from a user-speciﬁed library of existing prediction methods using cross- validation. In addition, we illustrate the application of IPW estimation with a time-varying polychotomous (nonbi- nary) exposure. All illustrations are based on results for one survival outcome, the worsening of glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR). 2. An observational, multicenter, retrospective cohort study We searched the entire adult membership of four partici- pating HMORN health plans for enrollees meeting the eli- gibility criteria described in Appendix A. We enrolled each patient at the earliest date between January 1, 2006 and June 30, 2009, on which all criteria were met. As in a clin- ical trial, these eligibility criteria were devised to identify adults for whom the CER question is relevant, that is, adults with new-onset T2DM deﬁned based on one elevated A1c measurement (O6.5%) or two elevated measurements from fasting (O126 mg/dL) or random (O200 mg/dL) plasma glucose tests within a 2-year period. We excluded members whose life expectancy was limited by selected comorbid conditions. These criteria identiﬁed a cohort of 51,430 pa- tients from which members with an observed or imputed baseline A1c �8% were excluded. All 36,020 patients from the resulting cohort were followed up from the study entry until the earliest of June 30, 2010, plan disenrollment, or death. 3. Analytic approach 3.1. Motivation for MSM To address the CER question, we aim to emulate infer- ences from an ideal randomized experiment with observa- tional data [3]. In the hypothetical trial of interest, patients from the study cohort described previously would be randomized to one of several treatment arms corre- sponding with (1) no T2DM pharmacotherapy, (2) initiation of metformin monotherapy (met) at study entry, (3) initia- tion of sulfonylurea monotherapy (sul) at study entry, (4) initiation of bitherapy with metformin and sulfonylurea (met þ sul) at study entry, (5) met initiation at 6 months af- ter study entry, (6) sul initiation at 6 months after study en- try, (7) met þ sul initiation at 6 months after study entry, and (8) met initiation at 12 months after study entry, and so forth. This trial is ideal in the sense that patients would remain uncensored for the duration of the trial (2 years) and patients in arm (1) would comply with the assigned lack of therapy, whereas patients in all other arms would comply with the assigned treatment regimen until at least the as- signed time of treatment initiation. In each arm, patients’ GFR would be monitored to detect evidence of ﬁrst GFR worsening after study entry. The corresponding survival curve in each arm would be contrasted at 2 years. More speciﬁcally, the cumulative risk differences between any two treatment interventions in this trial are the comparative effectiveness measures that we wish to evaluate with obser- vational data. Standard modeling approaches are known [4,5] to be in- adequate to handle time-dependent confounding and selec- tion bias [6] as they rely on conditioning of time-varying covariates, which are also often expected to lie on a causal pathway of interest between one of the variables deﬁning the exposure groups of interest and the outcome. Fig. 1 il- lustrates such a scenario with a causal diagram [7,8] of a subset of measurements collected over 1 year for each pa- tient in this study. MSM with IPW estimation can permit adequate adjustment for such time-varying covariates also on a causal pathway between early therapy exposure and the outcome and can directly emulate inference for the intention-to-treat (ITT) effects of interest [9e11] in this study (These effects are referred to as ITT effects because their interpretation is similar to the interpretation of S100 R. Neugebauer et al. / Journal of Clinical Epidemiology 66 (2013) S99eS109  conventional ITT effects in the sense that, in the hypothet- ical trial of interest, patients adhere to the assigned treat- ment regimen up to and at the assigned time of treatment initiation and may be nonadherent [by discontinuing or changing pharmacotherapy] thereafter.). 3.2. Data structure The observed data on each patient in this study consist of exposure, outcome, and confounding variable measure- ments made at 180-day intervals until each patient’s end of follow-up. Patient follow-up ended at the earliest of the time to GFR worsening or the time to a censoring event. The longest follow-up time was approximately 4 years, and the median follow-up time was about 1.5 years. Censoring events included administrative end of study, health plan dis- enrollment, death, or insufﬁcient GFR monitoring. GFR worsening was deﬁned as moving from a lower number re- nal function stage at baseline to a higher number stage based on any single follow-up GFR measurement. Renal function was classiﬁed as stage 1 (estimated GFR [eGFR] � 90 mL/min/1.73 m2), stage 2 (eGFR 60e89), stage 3a (eGFR 45e59), stage 3b (eGFR 30e44), stage 4 (eGFR 15e29), and stage 5 (eGFR ! 15). Insufﬁcient GFR monitoring was deﬁned as a gap between consecutive GFR measurement that exceeded 360 days (two 180-day intervals); the censoring date was set as the beginning date of the third 180-day interval. Each patient’s exposure to an intensiﬁed DM treatment during each 180-day follow-up interval was categorized in six levels: (1) no T2DM phar- macotherapy, (2) met, (3) sul, (4) met þ sul, (5) other T2DM pharmacotherapies, and (6) undetermined. The ex- posures were characterized with the ﬁrst ﬁve levels until and at the 180-day interval at which the patient initiated a ﬁrst-line pharmacotherapy. The exposures were not deter- mined (level six) thereafter because such information is ir- relevant for the investigation of the ITT effect of interest in this analysis. Each patient’s covariate (e.g., A1c measure- ments) and outcome (indicator of GFR worsening) at each 180-day follow-up interval were deﬁned from measurements assumed not to be affected by the exposure at that time interval of thereafter. Details about the ap- proach implemented for mapping EHR data into this coars- ened exposure, covariate, and outcome data for each patient were described elsewhere ([12], Appendix E). A formal presentation of the observed data structure on which the MSM analysis reported here is based is given in Appendix B for the purpose of allowing a detailed descrip- tion of our application of IPW estimation with a polychoto- mous (nonbinary) exposure. 3.3. Assumptions Success in emulating causal inferences from the hypo- thetical randomized trial of interest using observational data with the MSM approach described in the later section relies on assumptions [5,13e17] including the following: 3.3.1. No unmeasured confounders assumption This assumption is not testable with data alone but may be motivated based on a causal directed acyclic graph such as the one in Fig. 1. For example, in this analysis, this as- sumption would hold if all risk factors for the outcome that also affect censoring and the decision to initiate a particular therapy were included in the observed covariate process. Appendix C describes the time-independent and time- varying covariates selected for confounding and selection bias adjustment in this analysis. 3.3.2. Positivity assumption (aka, experimental treat- ment assignment assumption) Patient’s censoring status and exposure to the therapies of interest at any given 180-day interval should not be de- termined deterministically based on past observed covariates. 3.4. Road map of the MSM approach The road map of the analytic approach starts with the speciﬁcation of an MSM for representing the hazards in Fig. 1. Directed acyclic graph that represents plausible causal relationships between a subset of the variables collected on any given patient in the ﬁrst year of this study. Standard modeling approaches are not adequate to account for time-varying covariates such as L(1) (e.g., A1c is both a me- diator of the effect of early treatment decisions A(0) on the outcome Y(2) and a confounder of the effect of subsequent treatment decision A(1) on the outcome Y(2)). GFR, glomerular ﬁltration rate. S101 R. Neugebauer et al. / Journal of Clinical Epidemiology 66 (2013) S99eS109  each arm of the hypothetical trial of interest. The assumed logistic MSM in this analysis is described in Appendix D. The second step consists of estimating the unknown components of the numerators and denominators of stabi- lized weights (Appendix D) [18e20]. The numerators of the weights were estimated nonparametrically. We describe the estimation approaches considered for the denominators in the Motivation for SL section. The third step consists of ﬁtting the logistic marginal structural model by standard weighted logistic regression with follow-up data from each patient pooled over time and in which only the person-time observations under the treatment regimens of interest (i.e., corresponding with the treatment interventions in the hypothetical arms of in- terest) contribute to the regression. Each person-time obser- vation is weighted using the estimated stabilized weights. The fourth step consists of analytically mapping the es- timates of the hazards into the estimates of the survival curves of interest [21] using the formula linking discrete- time hazards to survival probabilities (Appendix D). For the ﬁfth and ﬁnal step, the estimates of the survival curves are contrasted. In this study, differences of survival at 2 years are of interest. Using the delta method [22] and the inﬂuence curve [23,24] of the IPW estimator of the MSM coefﬁcients, we analytically derived asymptotically conservative inference (conﬁdence intervals and P-values) for these cumulative risk differences. 4. Motivation for SL The success of the MSM approach described previously relies on not only the assumptions of positivity and no un- measured confounders but also the consistent estimation of the denominators of the stabilized weights. Their estima- tion has typically relied on parametric models (maximum likelihood estimation). The latter assumption then corre- sponds to correct model speciﬁcation. We implemented two such estimation strategies that are respectively based on (1) 11 logistic models with main terms for each explanatory variable considered and no in- teraction terms and (2) the same 11 logistic models except that the two terms for the latest A1c and change in A1c levels were replaced by main terms for 10 dummy variables (I[A1c ! 6%], I[6% � A1c ! 6.5%], I[7% � A1c ! 7.5%], I[7.5% � A1c ! 8%], I[A1c � 8%], I [A1c change ! �1%], I[�1% � A1c change ! �0.5%], I[�0.5% � A1c change ! 0%], I[0.5% � A1c change ! 1%], I[A1c change � 1%], where I[$] denotes indicator variables) indicating whether the continuous values for A1c and change in A1c levels were elements of given intervals. We refer to these strategies as estimation approaches with linear and nonlinear adjustments for A1c. In both approaches, each of the 11 models is used to esti- mate a distinct component of the denominators of the stabi- lized weights. Appendix E describes these components and explains why the following 11 models are sufﬁcient for es- timating the denominators of the stabilized weights: eight models for predicting each of the four types of therapy ini- tiation during the ﬁrst 180 days (6) and after the ﬁrst 180 days (7), three models for predicting censoring because of disenrollment from the health plan (3), death (4), and ar- tiﬁcial censoring for insufﬁcient GFR monitoring (5) (we assumed that censoring because of administrative end of study was uninformative). The explanatory variables con- sidered in this analysis were all time-independent covari- ates, the last measurement of time-varying covariates (Appendix C), and the variable indexing the 180-day follow-up intervals. In addition, past pharmacotherapy ini- tiation was included as an explanatory variable for the three models predicting censoring, and the latest change in A1c was included as an explanatory variable for the eight models predicting pharmacotherapy initiation. As is the aforementioned case, the parametric models adopted for estimating the denominators of the stabilized weights in practice do not typically reﬂect true subject mat- ter knowledge. To avoid erroneous inference [25,26] be- cause of arbitrary model speciﬁcations, data-adaptive estimation of the stabilized weights has been proposed but is still implemented rarely in practice [27e31]. Consis- tent IPW estimation then relies on judicious selection of a machine learning algorithm also known as ‘‘learner.’’ Several learners are potential candidates for estimating the different components of the denominators of the stabi- lized weights (e.g., [32e41]). Akin to the selection of a parametric model, the selection of a learner does not typ- ically reﬂect real subject matter knowledge about the rela- tive suitability of the different learners available because ‘‘In practice, it is generally impossible to know a priori which learner will perform best for a given prediction prob- lem and data set’’ [42]. To hedge against erroneous inference because of arbi- trary selection of a learner, SL [42] may be implemented [43] to combine predicted values from a library of various candidate learners (that includes the arbitrary learner that would have been guessed otherwise) through a weighted average. The selection of the optimal combination of the candidate learners is based on cross-validation [44e47] to protect against overﬁtting such that the resulting learner (called super learner) performs asymptotically as well (in terms of mean error) or better than any of the candidate learners considered. If the arbitrary learners that would have been guessed are based on a parametric model and happens to be correct, then using SL instead of the correctly guessed learner only comes at a price of increase in predic- tion variability. For this analysis, we implemented [48] 11 super learners as alternatives to the 11 logistic models described earlier for estimating the denominators of the stabilized weights. Each super learner is deﬁned based on seven candidate learners: (1) ﬁve learners deﬁned by logistic models with only main terms for the most predictive explanatory S102 R. Neugebauer et al. / Journal of Clinical Epidemiology 66 (2013) S99eS109  variables identiﬁed by a signiﬁcant P-value in univariate re- gressions with ﬁve signiﬁcance levels and (2) two polychot- omous regression learners based on the most predictive explanatory variables identiﬁed by a signiﬁcant P-value in univariate regressions with two signiﬁcance levels. Only the continuous A1c and change in A1c measurements were considered as explanatory variables for SL, that is, the dummy variables deﬁned earlier for nonlinear adjustment for A1c were not considered. Appendix F describes the de- tails of the implementation of the super learners considered in this analysis. 5. Results Of 34,468 patients in the study cohort, 15.7% experi- enced worsening of GFR during follow-up. Among the pa- tients who did not experience worsening of GFR during follow-up, 73.6% were followed until the end of the study period, and 16.7%, 1.2%, and 8.5% of the patients were lost to follow-up because of health plan disenrollment, death, and insufﬁcient GFR monitoring, respectively. Of all the patients in the cohort, 28.2% initiated pharmacotherapy for T2DM during follow-up. Of the patients initiating ther- apy, 7,021 (72.3%) did so within the ﬁrst 180 days. Across the entire study period, a total of 9,714 patients initiated therapy, with 7,192 (74%), 981 (10.1%), and 950 (9.8%) initiating treatment with met, sul, and met þ sul, respectively. We only report results obtained by contrasting estimates of the counterfactual survival curves under no therapy or three ITT therapy regimens (met, sul, and met þ sul) initi- ated in the ﬁrst 180 days of follow-up. Fig. 2 represents four estimates of these survival curves: (1) crude estimates cor- responding with IPW estimates based on weights equal to 1, (2) IPW estimates based on weights estimated using 11 lo- gistic models with linear adjustment for A1c, (3) IPW esti- mates based on weights estimated using 11 logistic models IPW estimates with Super Learning Fig. 2.

The relative predic- tive power of each learner that composes the 11 super learners is described in Table 2. For each of these estimates, Table 3 provides inferences about the cumulative risk dif- ferences at 2 years. Depending on the weight estimation ap- proach used, the 98th and 99th percentiles of the stabilized weights ranged approximately 18e24 and 37e46, respec- tively. Stabilized weights were truncated at 50 to improve the performance of the three IPW estimators considered [49e51]. 6. Discussion The results of this analysis illustrate the sensitivity of IPW inferences to the strategy adopted for estimating the denominator of the stabilized weights. In particular, the three IPW inferences about the risk difference between the no therapy and met þ sul exposure groups (bold text in Table 3) are striking. Although results from randomized trials are not avail- able in this study to serve as surrogate gold standards to for- mally evaluate the accuracy of inferences derived from the three estimation strategies for the stabilized weights, it is worth noting that almost all 11 arbitrary speciﬁed logistic models with linear A1c adjustment for estimating the de- nominators of the stabilized weights had higher cross- validated residual sum of squares (not reported) than their 11 counterparts based on nonlinear A1c adjustment. This observation provides support for favoring inferences based on IPW estimation with nonlinear A1c adjustment, which are overall concordant with inferences based on IPW esti- mation with SL. Although the 11 super learners could not make use of the dummy variables that permitted manual nonlinear ad- justment for A1c, the SL algorithm appears (from the con- cordance of the results from IPW estimation with SL and that from IPW estimation with nonlinear adjustment for Table 1.

This report illustrates that differences between results from trials and advanced analytic methods such as MSM with IPW estimation in observational studies may not nec- essarily reﬂect real differences between efﬁcacy and effec- tiveness but biased estimates of effectiveness because of arbitrary and incorrect parametric modeling decisions. This report also demonstrates the feasibility of SL estimation in a study based on large health care databases for the purpose of automating ﬂexible confounding or selection bias adjust- ment from existing machine learning algorithms and hedg- ing against incorrect inferences that may otherwise arise from arbitrary parametric assumptions.

The time when the patient’s follow-up ends is denoted by ~T and is deﬁned as the earliest of the time to failure (i.e., GFR worsening) denoted by T or the time to a right-censoring event denoted by C. Renal function was classiﬁed as stage 1 when eGFR was �90 mL/min/1.73 m2, stage 2 for eGFR 60e89, stage 3a for eGFR 45e59, stage 3b for eGFR 30e44, stage 4 for eGFR 15e29, and stage 5 for eGFR !15. GFR worsening was deﬁned as movement from any lower numbered stage at baseline to any higher numbered stage based on a single follow-up GFR measurement. Patients were artiﬁcially right censored the ﬁrst time there was a gap longer than two 180-day intervals between two consecutive GFR mea- surements. The artiﬁcial censoring event was set at the third 180-day period of such a gap. When ~T5C, the type of right-censoring event experienced by the patient is denoted by G, with possible values 1, 2, 3, or 4 to represent the end of follow-up by administrative end of study, disenrollment from the health plan, death, or insufﬁcient GFR monitoring, respectively. The indicator that the follow-up time ~T is equal to the failure time T is denoted by D5Ið ~T5TÞ. At each time point t50; .; ~T, the patient’s exposure to an in- tensiﬁed DM treatment is represented by the variable A1(t), and the patient’s right-censoring status is denoted by the in- dicator variable A2(t) 5 I(C � t). The combination A(t) 5 (A1(t), A2(t)) is referred to as the action at time t. The treat- ment variable A1(t) is polychotomous with six possible levels zero through ﬁve to represent (1) no T2DM pharma- cotherapy, (2) met, (3) sul, (4) met þ sul, (5) other T2DM pharmacotherapies, and (6) undetermined, respectively. The exposures were characterized with values 0 and 4 until and at the 180-day interval, during which the patient initi- ated a ﬁrst-line pharmacotherapy. The exposures were not determined thereafter, that is, characterized with value 5 because such information is irrelevant for the investigation of the ITT effect of interest. At each time point t50; .; ~T, covariates (e.g., A1c measurements) are denoted by the multidimensional variable L(t) and deﬁned as measure- ments that occur before A(t) or are otherwise assumed not to be affected by the actions at time t or thereafter (A(t), A(t þ 1),.). For each time point t50; .; ~T þ 1, the out- come (i.e., the indicator of past failure) is denoted by Y(t) 5 I(T � t � 1) and is an element of the covariates at time t, L(t). By deﬁnition, the outcome is thus 0 for t50; .; ~T, missing at t5 ~T þ 1 if D 5 0 and 1 at t5 ~T þ 1 if D 5 1. To simplify notation, we use overbars to denote covariate and exposure histories, for example, a patient’s exposure history through time t is denoted by AðtÞ5ðAð0Þ; .; AðtÞÞ. Following the MSM framework [18], we approached the observed data in this study as re- alizations of n independent and identically distributed cop- ies of O5ð ~T; D; ð1 � DÞG; Lð ~TÞ; Að ~TÞ; DYð ~T þ 1ÞÞ denoted by Oi for i 5 1,., n, where n 5 34,468 (1,552 patients were excluded from the study cohort in the GFR analysis because of missing GFR measurements at baseline) repre- sents the sample size. The approach implemented for map- ping EHR data into the coarsened observed data Oi for each patient i was described elsewhere ([12], Appendix E). The longest observed follow-up time was maxi51;.;n ~Ti57 (z4 years), and the median follow-up time was about 1.5 years. S106 R. Neugebauer et al. / Journal of Clinical Epidemiology 66 (2013) S99eS109  Appendix C Covariates considered in the analysis The following time-independent covariates were consid- ered for confounding and selection bias adjustment: age at study (years), sex (male or female), median neighborhood household income in the patients census block, prospective DxCG risk scores based on baseline diagnoses and pre- scriptions [52], race (White, Black, Asian, Paciﬁc Islander, Native American, Hispanic, or unknown), baseline eGFR (�90, 60e89, 45e59, 30e44, 15e29, or !15), study site (Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, Northwest, Ha- waii, or Colorado), and reason for study entry (FPG only, RPG only, A1c only, FPG and RPG, or multiple reasons). In addition, the following time-varying covariates were considered for confounding and selection bias adjustment: a history of arrhythmia, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, or peripheral arterial disease; body mass index; hemoglobin A1c; lipoprotein values (low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and triglyceride); blood pressure values (systolic and dia- stolic blood pressures); and albuminuria level (microalbu- min/creatinine ratio !30, 30e300, or O300). Appendix D Details of the MSM approach We assumed the following logistic MSM mðt; a1ðt � 1ÞjbÞ for the discrete-time counterfactual hazards P½Yaðt�1ÞðtÞ5 1jYaðt�1Þðt � 1Þ50�, where b5ðbjÞj50;.;8 is a nine-dimensional coefﬁcient and the subscript notation Yaðt�1Þ is used to represent the counterfactual outcomes of in- terest (where a2ðt � 1Þ50) ([12], Appendix B): expit 2 64 X3 j50bjIðt 5jÞ þ b4Iðt˛f4;5gÞ þ b5Iðt˛f6;7gÞ þ X x˛f1;2;3gb5þx I½x˛a1ðt � 1Þ� |ﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄ{zﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄ} indicator of previous initiation of therapy x 3 75 This MSM was ﬁtted by standard weighted logistic re- gression with weights deﬁned by: Qt�1 j50P � AðjÞ ��YðjÞ50;Aðj � 1Þ � Qt�1 j50P � AðjÞ ��YðjÞ50;LðjÞ;Aðj � 1Þ � The resulting estimates of the coefﬁcients b of the logistic MSM are denoted by bn and were used to derive estimates of the counterfactual survival curves of interest, PnðTa1ðtÞOtÞ, based on the formula linking discrete-time hazards to survival probabilities: Pn � Ta1ðtÞOt � 5 Y tþ1 j51 f1 � m½j;a1ðj � 1Þjbn�g Appendix E Decomposition of the denominator of the stabilized weights The three strategies considered for estimating the de- nominators of the stabilized weights in this report are based on the following probability factorization using the chain rule: P � AðtÞ ��YðtÞ50;LðtÞ;Aðt � 1Þ � 5P � A2ðtÞ ��YðtÞ50;LðtÞ; Aðt � 1Þ � � P � A1ðtÞ ��YðtÞ50;LðtÞ;Aðt � 1Þ;A2ðtÞ � because A(t) 5 (A1(t), A2(t)). Given that only the person- time observations collected before censoring can contribute to the ﬁtting of the MSM, only the following two condi- tional probabilities need to be estimated: P � A2ðtÞ50 ��YðtÞ50;A2ðt � 1Þ50;LðtÞ;A1ðt � 1Þ � ð1Þ and P � A1ðtÞ ��YðtÞ50;LðtÞ;A1ðt � 1Þ;A2ðtÞ50 � ð2Þ For clarity, ðYðtÞ50; A2ðt � 1Þ50; LðtÞ; A1ðt � 1ÞÞ and ðYðtÞ50; LðtÞ; A1ðt � 1Þ50; A2ðtÞ50Þ are denoted below by FðtÞ and GðtÞ, respectively. The conditional probability (1) can be factorized using the chain rule and information about the different types of possible censoring events: P½A2ðtÞ50jFðtÞ�5ð1� PfI½A2ðtÞ51;G51�51jFðtÞgÞ�ð1 � PfI½A2ðtÞ51; G52�5 1jFðtÞ;I½A2ðtÞ51;G51�50gÞ�ð1�PfI½A2ðtÞ51;G53�51j FðtÞ; I½A2ðtÞ51; G51�50; I½A2ðtÞ51; G52�50gÞ � ð1� PfI½A2ðtÞ51;G54�51jFðtÞ;I½A2ðtÞ51;G51�50; I½A2ðtÞ5 1; G52�50; I½A2ðtÞ51; G53�50gÞ because A2(t) 5 0 is equivalent to ðI½A2ðtÞ51;G51�50; .; I½A2ðtÞ51; G54�5 0Þ, where I[A2(t) 5 1, G 5 j] is the indicator of censoring by an event of type G 5 j. The ﬁrst probability on the right- hand side of the previous equality may be ignored from the deﬁnition of the denominator of the weights (and thus does not need to be estimated) if one assumes that censoring be- cause of administrative end of study is not informative, that is, PfI½A2ðtÞ51; G51�51jFðtÞg is only a function of time t. Thus, the only three conditional probabilities of censor- ing that need to be estimated to estimate the stabilized weights are as follows: PfI½A2ðtÞ51;G52�51jFðtÞ;I½A2ðtÞ51;G51�50g ð3Þ PfI½A2ðtÞ51;G53�51jFðtÞ;I½A2ðtÞ51;G51�50; I½A2ðtÞ51;G52�50g ð4Þ S107 R.

Thus, only the following conditional probability needs to be esti- mated: P½A1ðtÞjGðtÞ�. Using the chain rule, this probability can be factorized as: P½A1ðtÞjGðtÞ�5PfI½A1ðtÞ5 1�jGðtÞg � PfI½A1ðtÞ52�jGðtÞ;I½A1ðtÞ51�g�PfI½A1ðtÞ53�jGðtÞ;I½A1ðtÞ5 1�; I½A1ðtÞ52�g � PfI½A1ðtÞ54�jGðtÞ; I½A1ðtÞ51�; I½A1ðtÞ5 2�; I½A1ðtÞ53�g because A1(t) can be equivalently coded with the following four dummy variables, which indicate treatment with one of the four therapies of interest (met, sul, met þ sul, or other): (I[A1(t) 5 1], I[A1(t) 5 2], I [A1(t) 5 3], I[A1(t) 5 4]). Note that the last three condi- tional probabilities on the right-hand side of the previous equality are equal to 1 when, respectively, I[A1(t) 5 1] 5 1, I[A1(t) 5 1] 5 1 or I[A1(t) 5 2] 5 1, and I[A1(t) 5 1] 5 1 or I[A1(t) 5 2] 5 1 or I[A1(t) 5 3] 5 1. Thus, the only four conditional probabilities that need to be esti- mated to estimate component (2) are as follows: PfI½A1ðtÞ51�51jGðtÞg, PfI½A1ðtÞ52�51jGðtÞ; I½A1ðtÞ51�5 0g, PfI½A1ðtÞ53�51jGðtÞ; I½A1ðtÞ51�50; I½A1ðtÞ52�50g, and PfI½A1ðtÞ54�51jGðtÞ; I½A1ðtÞ51�50; I½A1ðtÞ52�50; I½A1ðtÞ53�50g.

All routines referenced in the following are included in the R package with the exception of the R routine SL.po- lyclass given in the following. The ﬁve candidate learners based on logistic regression were implemented by the SL.glm routine using the tem- plate screening routine screen.glmP to deﬁne ﬁve nested subsets of explanatory variables based on the following ﬁve signiﬁcance levels: a 5 1e�30, 1e�10, 1e�5, and 0.1. The two candidate learners based on polychotomous regression were implemented by the SL.polyclass routine using the template screening routine screen.glmP to de- ﬁne two nested subsets of explanatory variables based on the following two signiﬁcance levels: a 5 1e�30 and 1. The R routine mentioned previously implements the polyclass learner [38] based on the Bayesian information criterion as the model selection criterion. To improve com- puting speed, this learner was favored over the SL.polymars routine that is available by default in the SuperLearner R package but that relies on cross-validation for model selection.

We explain how toestimate the observational analogs of intention-to-treat and per-protocol effects, using hazardratios and survival curves. For per-protocol effects, we describe two methods for adherenceadjustment via inverse-probability weighting.Study Design and Setting: Prospective observational study using electronic medical records ofindividuals aged 55-84 with coronary heart disease from >500 practices in the United Kingdombetween 2000-2010.Results: The intention-to-treat mortality hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) was 0.90 (0.84,0.97) for statins versus no treatment, 0.88 (0.73, 1.06) for statins plus antihypertensives versus notreatment, and 0.91 (0.77, 1.06) for atorvastatin versus simvastatin. When censoring non- adherent person-times, the per-protocol mortality hazard ratio was 0.74 (0.64, 0.85) for statinsversus no treatment, 0.55 (0.35, 0.87) for statins plus antihypertensives versus no treatment, and1.13 (0.88, 1.45) for atorvastatin versus simvastatin. We estimated per-protocol hazard ratios fora 5-year treatment using different dose-response marginal structural models, and standardizedsurvival curves for each target trial using intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses.Conclusion: When randomized trials are not available or feasible, observational analyses canemulate a variety of target trials.

When randomized trials are not available, one can use observational data totry to emulate the (hypothetical) target trial that we would like to conduct but we cannot (3).Availability of electronic health records has increased the potential for conducting suchobservational analyses (4). We have previously used electronic medical records to compare anactive treatment (statin therapy) versus no treatment for primary prevention of coronary heartdisease (5). Our analysis illustrated how, even in the presence of strong confounding byindication, high-quality and properly analyzed observational data may yield effect estimates thatare consistent with those from randomized trials. This report extends our previous work on primary prevention of coronary heart disease (5) andemulates the design and analysis of secondary prevention trials that compare joint treatment (acombination of two or more treatments) versus no treatment, and head-to-head trials thatcompare two active treatments. We present methods to estimate the analogs of the intention-to- treat and per-protocol effects and describe how to estimate standardized survival curves toovercome the limitations of hazard ratios (6) for comparative effectiveness research.MethodsStudy populationThe Health Improvement Network is a database of medical records from more than 500 primarycare practices in the United Kingdom. The database includes demographic information,symptoms and diagnoses, referrals and hospitalizations, outpatient prescriptions, test results and  MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 8some lifestyle information. Drug prescriptions are also taken from the general practitioners’database and disease diagnoses have been recorded using standard READ codes. We includeddata from January 1st 2000 through December 31st 2010.Three target trialsWe consider three target trials with a common set of baseline eligibility criteria: age 55 to 84years; prior myocardial infarction, angina pectoris or revascularization (qualifying event); no useof any statin in the past year; and no history of cancer, dementia, psychosis or chronic heart, liveror kidney failure. In all trials patients are followed from baseline (between January 2000 andJune 2010) until death (the primary outcome), or loss to follow-up. Patients are randomly assigned to usual care with or without statin therapy in target trial (i), tousual care with either a combination of statins and antihypertensives or neither therapy (no use ofany antihypertensive in the past year is an additional eligibility criterion) in target trial (ii), and tousual care with either atorvastatin or simvastatin therapy in target trial (iii). Statin therapy doesnot include cerivastatin, which was taken off the market due to safety concerns.Emulating the target trialsWe applied to the Health Improvement Network data the same baseline eligibility criteriadescribed above plus having at least 2 years of continuous recording in the database, at least onehealth contact within the past 2 years, and information on all potential confounders measured atleast once during the past 2 years (see list of potential confounders in Table 1 and AppendixTable 1). Individuals in the Health Improvement Network data can meet the eligibility criteria for eachtarget trial at several times. Rather than choosing one of those times (say, June 2005) as the  MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 9trial’s time zero, we emulated each target trial as a sequence of trials (5) that started at each ofthe 126 months between January 2000 and June 2010. Eligible individuals at each of the 126baselines were assigned to a treatment group and followed until age 85, death, or loss to follow- up (due to end of data collection at the patient’s practice). Individuals were included in allmonthly trials for which they met the eligibility criteria. In each monthly trial for the ‘single treatment’ trial (i), eligible individuals who initiated anystatin during the baseline month were assigned to the treatment arm and non-initiators to the no- treatment arm. In each monthly trial for the ‘joint treatment’ trial (ii), eligible individuals whoinitiated any statin during the baseline month and any antihypertensive therapy within 2 months(or vice versa) were assigned to the treatment arm, those initiating only statins orantihypertensives were excluded, and all others were assigned to the no-treatment arm. Therewere no deaths within the 2 months after initiating the first treatment and before starting thesecond treatment and only 4 patients were lost to follow-up during this period so there was noneed to use more complex approaches (7). In each monthly trial for the ‘head-to-head’ trial (iii),eligible individuals who initiated atorvastatin during the baseline month were assigned to onearm and those initiating simvastatin to the other arm; all others were excluded. Participantsinitiating both atorvastatin and simvastatin were assigned to atorvastatin in the main analysis andto simvastatin in a sensitivity analysis (estimates did not materially change; data not shown).Estimating the observational analog of the intention-to-treat effectIn a randomized trial, the intention-to-treat effect is the effect of being assigned to a treatmentstrategy. To estimate an observational analog, we estimated the effect of being prescribedtreatment by pooling the data across all monthly trials (for statistical efficiency) and fitting a  MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 10pooled logistic regression model as explained in the Appendix. Depending on the trial beingemulated, the indicator for treatment was coded as 1 for (i) statin, (ii) statin plus antihypertensivetherapy, or (iii) atorvastatin, and 0 for the corresponding reference group. Assuming nounmeasured confounding given the covariates included in the model, and a low monthlymortality risk (e.g. <10%) within levels of these covariates, the coefficient for treatment indicatorapproximates the intention-to-treat log mortality hazard ratio (8) of a target trial with the sameadherence pattern as the Health Improvement Network data. Because of the limitations of hazard ratios as effect measures,(6) we also estimated survivalcurves for each arm by fitting a pooled logistic model similar to the one explained above exceptthat it included product (“interaction”) terms to allow the hazard ratio to change over time.predicting the conditional survival at each time, and standardizing the survival probabilities tothe joint distribution of the selected confounders at baseline (see Appendix for details). Estimating the observational analog of the per-protocol effect In a randomized trial, the per-protocol effect is the effect that would have been observed had allindividuals adhered to their assigned treatment strategy throughout the follow-up. We havepreviously implemented two methods to estimate the observational analog of the per-protocoleffect (5). We now describe these two methods for trials (i), (ii), and (iii):1. Censoring at discontinuation of the treatment strategy assigned at baseline. For trial (i),we censored individuals in the treatment group when they discontinued statin therapy andthose in the no treatment group when they initiated statin therapy. For trial (ii), wecensored individuals in the treatment group when they discontinued either statins orantihypertensives, and those in the no treatment group when they initiated either therapy.  MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 11For trial (iii), we censored individuals when they discontinued their assigned activetreatment (i.e. atorvastatin or simvastatin). For all trials, we then fit to the censored datathe same pooled logistic models described in the previous section to estimate the hazardratio and the survival curves.2. Specifying a dose-response marginal structural model (in reference (5) we impreciselyreferred to this as an ‘as-treated’ analysis). For all trials, we fit the same pooled logisticmodels described in the previous section to estimate the hazard ratio and the survivalcurves, with the exception that we replaced the indicator for treatment arm by a time- varying function of treatment use since baseline. Our main analysis used cumulative dose(linear and squared terms). In sensitivity analyses, we used five other dose-responsemodels: linear cumulative dose, cumulative average dose (linear term only, linear andsquared terms), and cumulative dose in the two most recent year plus cumulative dose inthe previous period (linear only, linear and quadratic). We then estimated the hazard ratioand survival for continuous treatment versus no treatment during the follow-up usingmodels that included product (“interaction”) terms between cumulative dose (or otherfunctions of treatment history) and follow-up time. Even when using a dose-response model, we used censoring to resolve estimation problemsin trial (i) and to preserve the interpretability of the estimates in trials (ii) and (iii). Because ofthe difficulty to model multiple treatment changes in trial (i), we censored individuals whenthey changed treatment 5 times during the follow-up (which led to excluding about 4% ofobservations). That is, we emulated a target trial in which the protocol did not allow subjectsto switch treatment more than 4 times. For target trial (ii), we censored individuals when theyreceived just one of the two active treatments (statins or antihypertensives); and for target  MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 12trial (iii), we censored individuals when they received neither of the two active treatments(atorvastatin or simvastatin).The above hazard ratio and survival estimates are adjusted for measured baseline confounders,but not for post-baseline, time-varying confounders (which predict treatment and thereforecensoring). To adjust for measured time-varying confounders, we weighted each individual’scontributions to the pooled logistic model by the subject-specific time-varying stabilized inverse- probability weights (see Appendix). Informally, the denominator of the inverse-probabilityweight is the probability that a subject received his own observed treatment given his pasttreatment and covariate history, and the numerator (the stabilizing factor) is the probability that asubject received his observed treatment conditional only on his past treatment history andbaseline prognostic factors. The stabilized inverse-probability weights create a ‘pseudo- population’ in which treatment is independent of prognostic factors history (9). To estimate the denominator of the weights for target trials (i) and (ii), we used the predictedvalues from two separate logistic models to allow the association between covariates andtreatment to vary by prior treatment status (see Appendix). We used the predicted probabilities oftreatment from these models to calculate the denominator of the weights, and a separate pair ofmodels without time-varying confounders to estimate the numerator of the weights. To estimate the denominator of the weights for the joint treatment trial (ii) and the head-to-headtrial (iii), we fit two nested logistic regression models (separately by treatment level in theprevious month). For target trial (ii) the first model estimated the monthly conditional probabilityof remaining uncensored, that is using either statin or antihypertensive; the second model  MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 13estimated the monthly probability of receiving both treatments among the uncensored. Becauseswitching from both treatments to no treatment in this target trial likely reflects a clinicalcontraindication for treatment, the protocol of the target trial allowed such a change, which weemulated by not updating the inverse-probability weights after discontinuing both treatments(<1% of observations). Similarly, for trial (iii), the first model estimated the monthly probabilityof receiving either atorvastatin or simvastatin. The second model estimated the monthlyprobability of receiving atorvastatin among those on one of the two active treatments. Westopped updating the IP weights when an individual switched from atorvastatin to simvastatinand vice versa which occurred in around 1% of observations, effectively emulating a protocolthat allowed individuals to make that change.To prevent undue influence by a limited number of observations with extreme weights, wetruncated the inverse-probability weights at their 99th percentile. We used nonparametricbootstrapping with 500 samples to calculate 95% confidence intervals for the survival differenceestimates and for hazard ratios in per-protocol analyses using a dose-response model (10). For allother hazard ratios, we used robust variances to calculate conservative 95% confidence intervalsusing fewer computational resources. All analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 (SAS InstituteInc., Cary, NC, USA). Relevant code and documentation are available atwww.hsph.harvard.edu/causal/software. ResultsFigure 1 summarizes the selection of individuals for each of the 3 target trials. Becauseindividuals may be eligible for multiple monthly trials, the total number of eligible individuals,  MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 14when pooled over all monthly trials, is greater than the number of unique individuals. Table 1and Appendix Table 2 present the baseline characteristics of the eligible individuals by initialtreatment. For example, for target trial (i) statin initiators were on average slightly younger, hadhigher low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels and more doctor visits andhospitalizations, and included more current smokers, diabetics and aspirin and beta-blockerusers. However, the differences were generally small. Appendix Table 2 presents thecharacteristics of all individuals that would have been eligible if complete data on potentialconfounders listed in Table 1 and Appendix Table 1 had not been an eligibility criterion. Target Trial (i): Single treatment with any statin versus no treatmentDuring 1.2 million person-years of follow-up, there were 229 deaths among initiators (meanfollow-up of 58 months) and 1950 deaths among non-initiators (mean follow-up of 48 months). The intention-to-treat mortality hazard ratio (95% CI) was 0.90 (0.84, 0.97) (Table 2). A productterm between the indicator for treatment initiation and baseline month had a P-value of 0.83,which supports our pooling the estimates across monthly trials. The survival difference (95% CI)between initiators and non-initiators was 0.3% (0.1%, 0.5%) at one year and 1.2% (0.5%, 2.1%)at 5 years of follow-up (Figure 2A).One-year and 5-year adherence to the baseline assignment was 72% and 56% in initiators, and81% and 45% in non-initiators, respectively (Figure 3A). Among initiators, predictors of higheradherence were lower LDL-cholesterol, frequent measurements of LDL-cholesterol and doctorvisits, and use of antihypertensives (Appendix Table 3).Table 2 also presents the two sets of per-protocol effect estimates. After censoring non-adherentperson-times, mean follow-up was 40 months among initiators (139 deaths) and 30 months  MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 15among non-initiators (965 deaths). The mean of the stabilized inverse-probability weights was1.10 (99th percentile: 2.86; Appendix Table 4) and 0.99 after truncation. The mortality hazardratio was 0.74 (0.64, 0.85) when censoring at non-adherence and 0.87 (0.73, 1.03) for 5 years ofcontinuous treatment with statins when using a dose-response model.The survival differencebetween continuous treatment and no treatment estimated by censoring at non-adherence was0.5% (0.2%, 0.9%) at 1 year and 3.2% (0.2%, 4.7%) at 5 years of follow-up (Figure 2B). Thedose-response model gave similar results (Figure 2C).Target Trial (ii): Joint treatment with statins and antihypertensives versus no treatmentDuring 154,259 person-years of follow-up, there were 26 deaths among initiators (mean follow- up of 56 months) and 302 deaths among non-initiators (mean follow-up of 51 months). Theintention-to-treat mortality hazard ratio for joint treatment with statins and antihypertensivesversus no treatment was 0.88 (0.73, 1.06) (Table 2). The survival difference between initiatorsand non-initiators was less than 1% at one year and 1% (-0.8%, 2.6%) at 5 years of follow-up(Figure 4A). One-year and 5-year adherence to the baseline treatment was 71% and 53% in initiators, and67% and 23% in non-initiators (Figure 3B). The per-protocol mortality hazard ratio forcontinuous treatment with statins and antihypertensives versus no treatment was 0.55 (0.35, 0.87)when censoring at non-adherence and 0.79 (0.42, 1.31) for 5 years of treatment when using adose-response model. The survival difference between continuous treatment and no treatmentestimated via censoring at non-adherence was less than 1% at 1 year and 3.2% (0.9%, 6.9%) at 5years of follow-up (Figure 4B). The survival curves estimated using the selected dose-responsecurves (i.e. linear and quadratic cumulative dose) showed a similar but smaller survival benefitfor the treated (Figure 4C).  MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 16Target Trial (iii): Head-to-head comparison of atorvastatin versus simvastatinDuring 22,738 person-years of follow-up, there were 270 deaths among atorvastatin initiators(mean follow-up 47 months) and 544 among simvastatin initiators (mean follow-up 37 months).The intention-to-treat mortality hazard ratio for atorvastatin versus simvastatin was 0.91 (0.77,1.06) (Table 2). The survival difference between initiators of atorvastatin and simvastatin wasless than 1% at 5 years (Figure 5A). One-year and 5-year adherence to the baseline treatment was 75% and 58% in initiators ofatorvastatin, and 72% and 54% in initiators of simvastatin (Figure 3C). The per-protocolmortality hazard ratio was 1.13 (0.88, 1.45) when censoring at non-adherence, and 1.18 (0.88,1.52) for 5 years of continuous treatment when using a dose-response model (Table 2). Thesurvival difference between continuous use of atorvastatin versus simvastatin was less than 1%at 1 year and -2.1% (-6.1%, 4.3%) at 5 years (Figure 5B) with similar results from the dose- response model (Figure 5C).The per-protocol estimates were sensitive to the choice of dose-response functions especially forthe joint treatment trial (ii) (Table 3). Under a variety of functional forms, the mortality hazardratios for five years of treatment ranged from 0.81 to 0.92 for target trial (i), from 0.78 to 1.05 fortarget trial (ii), and from 1.13 to 1.31 for target trial (iii). In trial (i), we conducted sensitivity analyses for key analytic decisions. First, we repeated theanalyses without the requirement for data on all baseline covariates, which showed that theexclusion of these individuals made our estimates of intention-to-treat hazard ratio moreconservative. Second, we allowed each patient to enroll only in one monthly trial. This did notchange the intention-to-treat estimate but increased the standard error of the log hazard ratio  MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 17from 0.038 to 0.073. That is, there are substantial gains in efficiency when we allow patients toenroll in more than one trial, even when using a robust variance. Third, we allowed prevalentusers, which resulted in 1.9 million monthly trials (rather than 310,641) and substantially alteredthe eligibility criteria and treatment strategies of the target trial. Specifically, the trial is nowconducted in a population that contains both statin users and nonusers, and in which eachindividual is assigned to either statin (no change if a user, initiation if a nonuser) or no statin(discontinuation if a user, no change if a nonuser). After adjusting for variables in Table 1 andAppendix Table 1, mortality hazard ratio for current users versus nonusers of statins in thismodified analysis was 0.91 (0.85, 0.97) and, after further adjustment for prior statin use, 0.85(0.80, 0.92). This small difference suggests a relatively small potential for differential survivalbias (11, 12). Finally, using a restricted cubic spline instead of linear and quadratic terms tomodel follow-up time did not materially change the intention-to-treat hazard ratio. DiscussionWe emulated target trials to estimate the effect of statins and antihypertensives on death afterCHD using electronic medical records. An explicit emulation prevents biases such as prevalentuser bias (13) and immortal time bias (14), and helps define the observational analog of per- protocol effects. We illustrated how one can estimate per-protocol effects via inverse-probabilityweighting (15) and by estimating both average hazard ratios and standardized survival curves(6). Similar approaches to estimate per-protocol effects can be adopted in randomized trials (16). Our effect estimates were weaker than those from true randomized trials. In the ‘singletreatment’ trial (i) for statin only, our mortality hazard ratio estimate was 0.90 compared with thepooled hazard ratio of 0.84 from a meta-analysis of secondary prevention randomized trials (17),and our survival difference at 60 months was 1.2% compared with 3.6% at 70 months in the 4S  MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 18trial (18). The weaker estimates may be due to confounding by unmeasured factors,measurement error, differences in study populations and length of follow-up, or lower adherenceto treatment in our population (28% non-adherence among initiators at 1 year compared withabout 15% by the end of follow-up in a review of randomized trials (17)). Specifically, the lowerhazard ratio of 0.73 for the first year of follow-up (Appendix Table 5) compared with 0.90 forthe entire follow-up, indicates that doctors tend to prescribe statins to patients with betterprognostic factors (which were not recorded in the database). This is in contrast to our previousfindings in a primary prevention analysis where the hazard ratio for statins and incident coronaryheart disease was higher in the first year of follow-up (5).In the ‘joint treatment’ trial (ii) for statins and antihypertensives versus no treatment, theintention-to-treat hazard ratio estimate of 0.88 had a wide 95% confidence interval and probablyunderestimated benefit of the joint treatment because of unmeasured confounding forantihypertensives. In fact, when we tried to emulate a target trial of antihypertensives vs. noantihypertensives (data not shown), the intention-to-treat hazard ratio suggested a 12% increaseddeath rate in the treatment group. In the ‘head-to-head’ trial (iii) for atorvastatin vs. simvastatin,the intention-to-treat hazard ratio of 0.91 had a wide 95% confidence interval and was consistentwith the lack of survival differences between different types of statins reported in a meta-analysisof randomized trials (19).We used two methods to estimate the per-protocol effect: a relatively inefficient censoringprocedure that does not require a dose-response model, and a theoretically more efficient methodthat will result in bias if the dose-response model is misspecified. In practice, the dose-responsemodel did not always result in more efficient estimates (even though censoring-based estimateshad conservative confidence intervals around them) because inverse-probability weights were  MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 19estimated during longer periods which resulted in loss of efficiency. Importantly, these effectestimates were sensitive to the choice of dose-response model. Further research into dose- response modeling for per-protocol effects is warranted (20, 21)Because per-protocol effects are defined as the effect that would have been observed under fulladherence, it is key to use a definition of adherence that is clinically meaningful. Specifically,individuals who discontinue treatment due to toxicity or other clinically mandated reasons are infact adhering to the protocol, as no reasonable clinical protocol would force patients to stay ontreatment in these situations. (22) Unfortunately, as we did not have data on the reasons tochange treatment, our per-protocol effect estimates considered all deviations from the baselinetreatment as non-adherence. We do not expect this limitation to have a substantial impact on theestimates because statins and antihypertensives have low rates of toxicity. (23, 24) Both methods for estimating the per-protocol effect used inverse-probability weighting to adjustfor time-varying confounding. Inverse-probability weights are sensitive to violations of thepositivity assumption (25), as a result of certain treatment-confounder combinations beingobserved in a small subset of the population. In conclusion, we described and implemented methods to emulate three types of randomizedtrials using observational data. We explained how to estimate the observational analogs of theintention-to-treat and per-protocol effects, and how to estimate standardized survival curves andquantify uncertainty in quantities of interest.

This article aimed to evaluate the relative efﬁcacy and safety of Rivaroxabanversus Dabigatran.Study design and setting: An emulated target trial analysis was conducted based on Medicare, in which we constructed three“randomized clinical trials” with well-deﬁned inclusion/exclusion criteria, treatment regimens, and analysis procedures. We analyzed theindividual trials, examined temporal variations, and generated uniﬁed results via pooled analysis.Results: With a two-year data collection window (2012–2013), 70,129 subjects were enrolled in the three emulated trials, with36,269 and 34,089 in the Rivaroxaban and Dabigatran arms, respectively. Dabigatran (the reference group for hazard ratio - HR) wassuperior regarding time to any primary event (including ischemic stroke, other thromboembolic events, major bleeding, and death; HR1.232, P -value 0.0025), major bleeding (HR 1.187, P -value < 0.0001), and mortality (HR 1.488, P -value < 0.0001). Differences regardingstroke and other thromboembolic events were not signiﬁcant.Conclusion: Dabigatran was found as superior for the Medicare patients with multiple chronic conditions. Temporal variations,which had been largely neglected in the literature, were observed. This study may provide new insight into treating AF with NOACs.© 2021 Elsevier Inc.

IntroductionAtrial ﬁbrillation (AF) is an abnormal heart rhythmcharacterized by rapid and irregular heart chamber beat-ings. It affects three to six million people in the U.S.,among whom 85% to 90% are eligible for oral anticoagu-lation therapies [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]. As established in the literature, it isof great interest to properly choose among non-vitamin Kantagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs). Rivaroxaban andDabigatran were approved by the U.S. FDA in November2011 and October 2010, respectively. They were the ﬁrsttwo NOACs for preventing stroke for non-valvular AF pa-tients and have been widely used since marketing. In 2014,they accounted for 74% of NOAC prescriptions during AFofﬁce visits [4] .https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2021.07.0010895-4356/© 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. H. Mei, J. Wang and S. Ma / Journal of Clinical Epidemiology 139 (2021) 28–3729In general, to draw deﬁnitive and objective conclusionson a drug’s treatment effect, well-controlled randomizedclinical trials are needed. There have been multiple tri-als comparing Dabigatran with Warfarin (e.g., the RE-LYtrial) and Rivaroxaban with Warfarin (e.g., the ROCKET-AF trial) [ 5 , 6 ]. These trials showed that both Rivaroxabanand Dabigatran were non-inferior to Warfarin in prevent-ing stroke and reducing bleeding risk. Recent studies, suchas DARING-AF and DANNOAC-AF, also tried to com-pare Rivaroxaban with Dabigatran [ 7 , 8 ]. However, theyhad limited sample sizes and broadly considered antico-agulants without speciﬁcally focusing on Rivaroxaban andDabigatran.With the popularity of these two drugs, it is of greatinterest to conduct a direct and focused comparative study.However, with the potentially high cost and their alreadybroad usage, such a randomized clinical trial is not fore-seeable. To tackle this problem, we resorted to the analysisof observational data, whose cost is negligible comparedto that of a clinical trial. For this speciﬁc comparison, ob-servational data has additional advantages. Speciﬁcally, ithad been noted that the administration and adherence pat-terns of Rivaroxaban and Dabigatran were different. In theexisting trials, the Rivaroxaban group took pills once a daytogether with an evening meal, and the Dabigatran grouptook pills twice daily. Such differences can lead to differ-ent adherence patterns, and these differences further differbetween controlled clinical trials and real-world practice[9] . From a public health perspective, real-world practice,which also accommodates the effects of behavioral fac-tors, can be of more interest. In this perspective, observa-tional data may more honestly reﬂect real-world treatmenteffects. In addition, as to be shown below, the availableobservational data was also considerably larger than manyclinical trials on related regimens.With observational data, the most straightforward ap-proach is to conduct a multivariable regression analysis[10–12] . The associations observed in regression, even af-ter controlling for confounding, may not reﬂect the desiredcausal treatment effects. Causal inference with observa-tional data is a “classic” and broad ﬁeld. The existing lit-erature is vast and has been reviewed elsewhere [13] . Dif-ferent approaches have different advantages and disadvan-tages, and there is no dominating approach. In this study,we adopted the emulation approach, which had been de-veloped through a series of publications on a variety ofillness conditions and treatment strategies [ 14 , 15–18 ]. Inemulation, clinical trials are explicitly assembled using ob-servational data, and statistical techniques for randomizedclinical trials are directly applied. Compared to some othercausal inference techniques, for example the targeted MLEand BART, emulation can have much more lucid interpre-tations [ 19 , 20 ].In this article, our goal was to conduct a direct compar-ison of Rivaroxaban and Dabigatran and draw more deﬁni-tive conclusions on their relative treatment effects, whichcan have high public health implications. Without an ac-tual trial, we analyzed the Medicare observational data.This database was chosen because of its broad coverage(hence more power and a better reﬂection of the generalU.S. population) and high data quality. Additionally, AFand the utilization of Rivaroxaban and Dabigatran couldbe more prevalent in the Medicare population than someothers. This study may advance the existing literature inmultiple important aspects. First, it was focused on Ri-varoxaban and Dabigatran and conducted a direct compar-ison. Second, it adopted the emulation approach to explic-itly assemble a clinical trial using observational data. Theconclusion so drawn can be more informative than thosefrom regression analysis and more lucid/interpretable thanthose using some other causal inference techniques. Third,it showcased a new way of analyzing the Medicare data tobetter inform clinical practice. Last, it marked a new ap-plication of the emulation technique. In addition, we alsoexamined temporal variations, which had been largely ne-glected in published emulation studies. Overall, this studymay provide a useful complement to the existing AF, clin-ical trial, emulation, and Medicare data analysis literature.2. Data source and study populationMedicare is a national health insurance program in theU.S. The Medicare claims are bills for services provided tothe Medicare beneﬁciaries: adults aged 65 years and above,certain younger people with disabilities, and people withend-stage renal diseases. Data analyzed in this study wasextracted from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Ser-vices (CMS) Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse (CCW).The CMS CCW offers a wide range of claims data thatfollows beneﬁciaries across multiple care settings. For ouranalysis, the Part A inpatient data and Part D prescrip-tion drug event data were used to identify eligible studysubjects (more details in Section 3.2 ). The Medicare bene-ﬁciary identiﬁcation number was used to link beneﬁciariesbetween the two datasets.Our study was focused on the subpopulation with mul-tiple chronic conditions (MCC – more details in Supple-mentary Table S1). This subpopulation had been stud-ied for cardiometabolic conditions, diabetes, and others[ 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 ]. Health-wise, this subpopulation is more vul-nerable. In particular, 80% of AF happens to patients 65years old and above [1] , and AF is often associated withMCC such as diabetes, dementia, and other heart diseases[2] . We further limited our study period to 2012–2013.The consideration was that by early 2012, both drugswere already extensively used (as such, a large samplesize/sufﬁcient power and broad representativeness couldbe achieved). A two-year study period is “normal” fora real phase III clinical trial. In addition, sufﬁciently de-tailed drug utilization information after 2013 was unavail-able to our study. As such, we were unable to deter-mine drug continuation or switch afterward. Overall, the 30H. Mei, J. Wang and S. Ma / Journal of Clinical Epidemiology 139 (2021) 28–37Fig. 1. Flowchart of assembling the emulated trials.source population included 35,758,327 subjects (before pa-tient selection), among whom 179,510 had taken Rivaroxa-ban or Dabigatran during the study period (more details inSection 3.2 ).3. MethodsIn emulation analysis, the ﬁrst step is to develop a ran-domized clinical trial protocol [14] . The trial can be a realone, a hypothetical one, or a mixture of both. Then anobservational data analysis protocol is developed to em-ulate this trial. Accordingly, we ﬁrst developed the trialprotocol in Section 3.1 . As there was no existing trial thatdirectly compared Rivaroxaban and Dabigatran, our designwas based on relevant trials particularly including RELYand ROCKET-AF as well as observational data analysis[ 25 , 26 ]. The emulated trial was designed in Section 3.2 ,with its analysis approaches described in Section 3.3 .3.1. The targeted randomized clinical trialThe trial targeted to address, for non-valvular AF pa-tients with MCC, whether treating with standard-dose Ri-varoxaban led to superior efﬁcacy (prevention of strokeand other thromboembolic events) and safety (bleeding andmortality) outcomes compared to standard-dose Dabiga-tran.The target trial enrolled participants 65 years old andabove, who were diagnosed with non-valvular AF withinthree months before enrollment and had MCC. A partici-pant was excluded if one or more of the following criteriawere met: (1) a prescription of an anticoagulant within H. Mei, J. Wang and S. Ma / Journal of Clinical Epidemiology 139 (2021) 28–3731three months before study entry [27] , (2) a NOAC prefer-ence different from the tested drugs, (3) conditions otherthan AF for the respective anticoagulant (mitral valve dis-ease, heart valve repair or replacement, deep vein throm-bosis, pulmonary embolism, or joint replacement) in threemonths preceding study entry, (4) being in a skilled nurs-ing facility, receiving hospice care, or being in hospitaliza-tion, and (5) having had a kidney transplant or undergoingdialysis.The trial was started on Jnuary 01, 2012. A three-monthwashout period was adopted with the consideration thatanticoagulants used for AF were usually prescribed in 30-day or 90-day cycles. This ensured that no previous usageof anticoagulants would inﬂuence our outcomes of interest.Randomization started on April 01, 2012, and the trial wasclosed on December 31, 2013. To gain insight into poten-tial temporal variations, we further dissected the 21-monthstudy period into three equal intervals. As such, there werea total of three trials, each with a 7-month recruitment pe-riod. As the whole study was concluded on December 31,2013, the three trials had different lengths of follow-up,which may provide insight into the impact of follow-uplength on clinical trial observations.After recruitment, an eligible participant was randomlyassigned to one of the two treatment arms. One arm re-ceived Rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily, and the other armreceived Dabigatran 150 mg twice daily. Each participantwas followed until death, loss to follow-up, or end of thestudy (December 31, 2013). A loss to follow-up was de-ﬁned as a discontinuation of treatment (a gap in the as-signed treatment for over 60 days) or switching NOAC ordosage, whichever occurred ﬁrst.The primary outcomes included time to ischemic stroke,other thromboembolic events (systemic embolism, tran-sient ischemic attack, pulmonary embolism), major bleed-ing, all-cause death, and the ﬁrst occurrence of any ofthe above. The secondary outcomes included time to anybleeding and acute myocardial infarction (AMI).3.2. The emulated trialThe emulated trial was designed largely in line withthat described above. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst identiﬁed Medi-care beneﬁciaries who ﬁled the ﬁrst prescription for eitherRivaroxaban or Dabigatran with the standard dosages be-tween April 01, 2012 and December 31, 2013. For thosepatients, data collection started on January 021, 2012, andthe ﬁrst three months of medical history data was used todetermine whether a patient satisﬁed the washout periodeligibility. The index date (time zero) was set as the dateof the ﬁrst drug prescription on or after April 01, 2012,mimicking the time of randomization. There could be a gapbetween drug prescription and treatment initiation (when apatient actually started taking the drug). However, it wasexpected to be very small compared to the survival out-comes, and there was no indication that it differed betweenthe two drugs. It was thus not further accounted for. Weincluded individuals who were 65 years old or above, hadat least three months of continuous enrollment in Medi-care, and had MCC. We excluded a subject if one or moreof the following criteria were met: (1) a prescription of ananticoagulant within three months before the index date(had not been washed-out); (2) a diagnosis indicating acondition other than AF for anticoagulation within threemonths before the index date; (3) being in a skilled nursingfacility, receiving hospice care, or being in hospitalization;and (4) having had a kidney transplant or undergoing dial-ysis. We also excluded individuals with incomplete datafor confounders at the baseline – with only 0.54% miss-ing data, we adopted comple-case-only analysis. The listof confounders is provided in Table 1 . Additional infor-mation on patient selection is provided in Fig. 1 , and therelated drug names and ICD-9-CM codes are provided inSupplementary Tables S2 and S3.The eligible subjects were classiﬁed into two treat-ment groups: Rivaroxaban and Dabigatran. Follow-up in-formation was extracted for each subject (to death, loss tofollow-up, or end of the study –December 31, 2013). Toidentify the primary outcomes, we tracked the study sub-jects to their ﬁrst Medicare inpatient claims with the pri-mary diagnosis code indicating each of the following: is-chemic stroke, other thromboembolic events, major bleed-ing, and all-cause death. For the secondary outcomes, weidentiﬁed all occurrences of any bleeding event (includingmajor bleeding) and AMI in the same manner. Detailedinformation on the ICD-9-CM codes for identifying theseevents is provided in Supplementary Table S4.We then created three subsequent trials to examine tem-poral variations. The same criteria and procedures wereapplied to the three trials to ensure comparability. All thetrials had a 7-month recruitment period: April 01, 2012– December 31, 2012, Noveber 01, 2012–May 31, 2013, andJune 01, 2013–December 31, 2013, respectively. However,they had different lengths of maximum follow-up: 21, 14,and 7 months, respectively. Detailed information on thesizes of each trial is provided in Fig. 1 .3.3. AnalysisIt has been recognized that an emulated trial may stilldiffer from its real counterpart in multiple ways. We re-fer to Hernan and Robins (2016) and Danaei (2018) fordiscussions [ 14 , 16 ]. As such, the analysis of an emulatedtrial, although similar to that for a real trial in many ways,also has differences.First, to emulate the intention-to-treat estimation, weused the observed therapy initiation (the ﬁrst ﬁll of Ri-varoxaban or Dabigatran, analog of random assignment ina clinical trial) as the treatment indicator. An observationwas censored when a participant discontinued or switchedtherapy. 32H. Mei, J. Wang and S. Ma / Journal of Clinical Epidemiology 139 (2021) 28–37Table 1.

As such, there may beno need for accounting for confounding – although it isstill commonly done out of caution. With emulated trials,since randomization does not really happen, there is a riskof imbalance, and so accounting for potential confoundingis strongly recommended in emulation trial analysis [14] .By reviewing RE-LY and ROCKET-AF, other trials, andpublished observational studies [ 25 , 26 ], and also takingdata availability into consideration, we included the follow-ing variables as potential confounders: demographic vari-ables (age, gender, race), medical conditions (AMI, con-gestive heart failure, previous stroke or transient ischemicattack, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic kidney dis-ease – CKD, history of bleeding, acquired hypothyroidism,and number of other CMS priority comorbidities), andmedication use (non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drug andantiplatelet). Details on these variables and preprocessingare provided in Supplementary Table S5. Information isalso provided in Table 1 .For each emulated trial and each outcome, we resortedto the propensity score and inverse probability treatment(IPT) weighting approach to achieve baseline balance asin a randomized clinical trial. In particular, to calculatethe propensity score, we estimated the probability of hav-ing a speciﬁc treatment using a logistic model and in-clude the baseline confounders described above as covari-ates [28] . Then the weight was calculated as the inverseof the propensity score for one treatment group and theinverse of one minus propensity score for the other group.By assigning such weights to study subjects, we createda pseudo-population, for which there existed no associa-tion between the baseline confounders and received treat-ment. Then the Cox proportional hazards model was ﬁttedto derive the treatment effect from the weighted pseudo-population. To further adjust for the remaining confound- H. Mei, J. Wang and S. Ma / Journal of Clinical Epidemiology 139 (2021) 28–3733ing and improve the precision of estimation, we includedthe treatment indicator and all baseline confounders as co-variates. The obtained hazard ratios (HRs) were our targetestimators for treatment effects. They were referred to as“adjusted” as the weighting process and outcome modeladjusted for the remaining confounding effects.With the three emulated trials, the above analysis gen-erated three sets of estimates. Beyond examining themindividually, we also generated uniﬁed results by pooledanalysis. In particular, we adopted a random effect mixedmodel approach, which assumed that the true effect satis-ﬁed a certain distribution and the observed study-speciﬁceffect could vary [29] . This approach can account for boththe within-study and between-study variances. We fed theestimated hazard ratios and corresponding variance estima-tors into this model, computed the weight for each set ofestimates as the inverse of the within- plus between-studyvariances, and generated a weighted average and combinedeffect.Remarks In some emulation studies, the sequential trialconcept and techniques were developed [ 16 , 17 , 30 ]. Oursetting had similarities with the sequential trials in thatthere were three trials conducted in a consecutive manner.However, the current setting was somewhat simpler thanthat in Danaei et al. (2018), Caniglia et al. (2020), andsome others [ 16 , 17 ]. First, we conducted the direct com-parison of two drugs without having controls waiting fora switch to treatment, which could creat signiﬁcant over-laps between trials. Second, the percentage of subjects in-cluded in more than one trial was only 3.54%, dramaticallysmaller than many existing emulation studies. With sucha small overlap, we were able to ignore the potential cor-relations between trials. Another difference was that weallowed temporal variations, as opposed to assuming thesame treatment effects. As such, we did not have the “in-ference with correlated trials” problem.4. Results4.1. Patient characteristics and unadjusted incidencesAs shown in Fig. 1 , our analysis included in total 70,129eligible participants, with 18,050, 28,880, and 25,767 ineach of the three emulated trials, respectively. The baselinecharacteristics by trial and treatment are shown in Table 1 .Before IPT weighting, participants treated with Rivaroxa-ban were slightly younger, more likely to be female, andwith somewhat less cardiovascular disease history.We then examined temporal variations of the baselinecharacteristics across the three trials. It was observed thatfor both arms, most of the baseline characteristics did notchange substantially over time. We observed that the num-ber of patients with CKD rose during the two years. ForRivaroxaban, the percentage of patients with CKD rosefrom 23.11% to 25.11% and then to 26.17%. For Dabiga-tran, the percentages were 27.76%, 27.66%, and 29.21%,Table 2.

A similar increase was observed in the vul-nerable patients with medical history (for example, havinga history of bleeding, stroke, or acquired hypothyroidism)during the two-year period.Table 2 shows the number of unadjusted incidence bytrial and treatment. For the three trials, the numbers of par-ticipants that developed any of the primary outcomes were1,717, 2,818, and 1,525, respectively; the numbers of par-ticipants lost to follow-up were 12,285, 15,333, and 8,850,respectively; and the numbers of participants that reachedthe end of follow-up without any primary outcome were4,048, 10,729, and 15,392, respectively. For Rivaroxaban,the average follow-ups were 273, 201, and 85 days for thethree trials, respectively; And for Dabigatran, the averagefollow-ups were 255, 210, and 97 days, respectively.4.2. Adjusted hazard ratio, temporal variation, andmeta-analysisAs shown in Supplementary Table S6, after the IPTweighting, all sample characteristics were more balancedbetween the two treatment groups. This was further con-ﬁrmed by Supplementary Figure S1, which showed almostidentical propensity score distributions for the weightedtrial 1 cohort. Similar plots were obtained for the othertwo trials.Table 3 contains the adjusted hazard ratio and P -valuefor each outcome by trial and treatment. Supplement Ta-ble S7 contains the pairwise comparisons of the estimatedtreatment effects. For the time to any primary outcome,Rivaroxaban had a signiﬁcantly higher hazard ratio in allthree trials. However, the magnitude of the estimated haz-ard ratio and P -value showed considerable temporal varia-tions. There were also temporal variations for the two pri-mary efﬁcacy outcomes. Rivaroxaban was found to have asigniﬁcant protective effect for ischemic stroke in trials 1and 2 but a non-signiﬁcant effect in trial 3. To get moreinsight into this difference, as an example, we showed inFig. 2 the Kaplan-Meier curves of ischemic stroke. Weacknowledged the different lengths of follow-up but alsonoted that the survival curves differed signiﬁcantly in theearly days of follow-up. As such, the observed differ-ences in treatment effects could not be fully attributedto the follow-up differences. For the other thromboem-bolic events, the two drugs were not signiﬁcantly differ-ent in all three trials. However, the estimated hazard ratioswitched sign between trial 1 and the other two. For allthe safety outcomes (all-cause mortality, major bleeding,and any bleeding), Rivaroxaban was observed to be signif-icantly inferior. Again, it was observed that the magnitudesof the estimated hazard ratios and P -values for bleedingoutcomes varied across the trials. For AMI, there were nosigniﬁcant differences between the two drugs for all threetrials.In the random-effect analysis, the pooled hazard ratiosuggested that, compared to Dabigatran, Rivaroxaban hadTable 3.

DiscussionsThe effectiveness of Rivaroxaban and Dabigatran forAF had been well established. With both extensively usedin clinical practice, our goal had been to conduct a directcomparison, which was missing in the literature. Withoutbeing able to conduct a real trial, we had resorted to theemulation approach to assemble trials based on observa-tional data. We noted that, in terms of statistical measures,there was no deﬁnitive conclusion on the performance ofdifferent causal inference techniques. The emulation ap-proach can be preferred with more intuitive interpretations.In addition, it can also provide guidance to the develop-ment of a real trial (if it ever becomes feasible). Lim-itations of emulation have been discussed in the litera-ture [ 13 , 14 , 16 , 30 ]. For example, it is rarely possible toemulate an ideal trial, because compromises have to bemade in eligibility criteria, treatment deﬁnition, and out-come measures. Other recognized limitations include miss-ing confounders, challenges on protocol speciﬁcation, andimmortal time bias [ 16 , 31 , 32 ]. Here with the high popu-larity of the two drugs, immortal time bias was expectedto be small. Without additional data and assumptions (not-ing that different approaches make different assumptions),it was not possible to correct for immortal time bias.We had analyzed the Medicare data, which is the mostcomprehensive and largest medical record database for se-niors in the U.S. Nevertheless, it has limitations. Speciﬁ-cally, as a medical claims database, it does not include cer-tain information [33] . As such, we were unable to verify ifthe two treatment groups were also balanced in other po-tentially relevant aspects – this limitation was also sharedby many other emulation and other causal inference studies[ 15 , 16 , 18 , 30 ]. Additionally, the lack of speciﬁc informationalso limited our ability to identify the target population. Forexample, the target clinical trial focused on patients whowere suitable for standard-dose treatment. However, sincethe patient’s creatinine clearance information was not avail-able, it was impossible to know whether each patient metthe dose-reduction criteria. Patients with overdose NOACmight have been included in the study population, affect-ing the bleeding outcomes. Medicare has almost univer-sal coverage for the U.S elderly population. As such, theﬁndings can be applied to this population with reasonableconﬁdence. Although there was no indication that the treat- 36H. Mei, J. Wang and S. Ma / Journal of Clinical Epidemiology 139 (2021) 28–37ment effects of Rivaroxaban and Dabigatran depended onrace and other demographic factors, the applicability ofour ﬁndings to other populations still needs further exam-ination. Moreover, we had limited data access, which hadled to an uncurrent dataset, a limited sample size, and alimited follow-up. On the other hand, there had been noindication in the literature that the treatment effects of thetwo drugs differed between the study and other periods.The sample size in this study had already been consider-ably larger than its peers [ 11 , 25 , 34 , 35 ]. In addition, therehad been a considerable number of events, even in the thirdtrial with the shortest follow-up.Our analysis led to the following main ﬁndings. Theﬁrst was that, based on both the individual trials andpooled analysis, Dabigatran was found to be superior toRivaroxaban in reducing safety concerns (bleeding eventsand overall mortality). This ﬁnding was consistent withobservational data analyses [ 25 , 26 , 34 , 36 ]. As discussed inGraham et al. (2016), the higher bleeding risk and mortal-ity of Rivaroxaban might be the side effects of the once-daily regimen, which led to higher peak and lower troughserum concentrations [26] . Another ﬁnding was that Ri-varoxaban and Dabigatran were not signiﬁcantly differentin preventing ischemic stroke and other thromboembolicevents. In some observational studies, results were non-conclusive regarding the preventive effects of Rivaroxabanversus Dabigatran [ 25 , 26 , 34–38 ]. This can be caused bydifferences in study populations and analysis techniques.As we did not have access to other data, it was impossibleto exactly pin down the causes. An interesting ﬁnding wasthe temporal variations. First, it was observed that in thestudy period, the prescription of Rivaroxaban was increas-ingly preferred over Dabigatran. In trial 1, the Rivaroxabangroup accounted for 32.58% of the study sample, whereasin trial 3, it accounted for 64.36%. Southworth et al. (2013)suggested that this change in prescription pattern might beattributed to post-marketing reports causing misconceivedbleeding risks with Dabigatran [39] . In addition, patientsinitiating Rivaroxaban were slightly younger and health-ier. Interestingly, some other studies had observed oppositeprescription patterns. Because Rivaroxaban had been stud-ied in older and higher-risk populations, some physicianswere more likely to prescribe Rivaroxaban to high-risk el-derlies 37 . Some other studies had also found that Rivaroxa-ban patients were older and with more comorbidities. Oneplausible explanation for the difference between this andthe other studies was that, our trial enrollment period in-cluded the early stage after Rivaroxaban’s new approval,and physicians often tended to use familiar (and seeminglysafer) drugs for sicker patients. This may also partly ex-plain the increasing prescription of Rivaroxaban over thetwo-year period.This study may be the ﬁrst to observe that certain ﬁnd-ings on treatment effects had temporal variations. In theexisting emulation studies, the study time periods wereusually not strongly justiﬁed, with the underlying belief (orassumption) that the ﬁndings should not depend on timeperiods. As can be partly seen from the survival curves,the observed differences were obvious. A deeper exami-nation suggested that the differences among the trials indemographic and clinical characteristics might not be suf-ﬁcient to explain the treatment effect differences. Addi-tional data (for example on possibly relevant but unmea-sured confounders) or approaches beyond emulation willbe needed to fully decipher the temporal variations. Thisanalysis may raise alarm for other emulation studies, whichmay also face temporal variations.6. Concluding RemarksThis study has provided a direct and objective compar-ison of the treatment effects of Rivaroxaban and Dabiga-tran via conducting an emulation analysis of the Medicaredata. The ﬁndings may assist clinicians in making more in-formed decisions in treating senior AF patients with MCC.This study has also provided another demonstration of ap-plying the emulation technique to draw causal conclusionsbased on observational medical record data. Despite certainlimitations, it can be informative for various stakeholders,including clinicians, patients, and biomedical/statistical re-searchers.7.

CLINICAL STUDY Transarterial Radioembolization for HepatocellularCarcinomawithMajorVascular Invasion: A Nationwide Propensity Score– Matched Analysis with Target Trial Emulation Sandi A. Kwee, MD, PhD, Linda L. Wong, MD, Miles M. Sato, MPH, Jared D. Acoba, MD, Young Soo Rho, MD, Avantika Srivastava, MS, and Douglas P. Landsittel, PhD ABSTRACT Purpose: To examine National Cancer Database (NCDB) data to comparatively evaluate overall survival (OS) between patients undergoing transarterial radioembolization (TARE) and those undergoing systemic therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma with major vascular invasion (HCC-MVI). Methods: One thousand ﬁve hundred fourteen patients with HCC-MVI undergoing ﬁrst-line TARE or systemic therapy were iden- tiﬁed from the NCDB. OS was compared using propensity score–matched Cox regression and landmark analysis. Efﬁcacy was also compared within a target trial framework. Results: TARE usage doubled between 2010 and 2015. Intervals before treatment were longer for TARE than for systemic therapy (mean [median], 66.5 [60] days vs 46.8 (35) days, respectively, P < .0001). In propensity-score–matched and landmark-time–adjusted analyses, TARE was found to be associated with a hazard ratio of 0.74 (95 % CI, 0.60–0.91; P ¼ .005) and median OS of 7.1 months (95 % CI, 5.0–10.5) versus 4.9 months (95 % CI, 3.9–6.5) for systemically treated patients. In an emulated target trial involving 236 patients with unilobular HCC-MVI, a low number of comorbidities, creatinine levels <2.0 mg/dL, bilirubin levels <2.0 mg/dL, and international normalized ratio <1.7, TARE was found to be associated with a hazard ratio of 0.57 (95 % CI, 0.39–0.83; P ¼ .004) and a median OS of 12.9 months (95 % CI, 7.6–19.2) versus 6.5 months (95 % CI, 3.6–11.1) for the systemic therapy arm. Conclusions: In propensity-score–matched analyses involving pragmatic and target trial HCC-MVI cohorts, TARE was found to be associated with signiﬁcant survival beneﬁts compared with systemic therapy. Although not a substitute for prospective trials, these ﬁndings suggest that the increasing use of TARE for HCC-MVI is accompanied by improved OS. Further trials of TARE in patients with HCC-MVI are needed, especially to compare with newer systemic therapies.

The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system and the guidelines of the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease and the European Association for the Study of the Liver presently recommend systemic therapy as the ﬁrst-line treatment for HCC complicated by MVI (HCC-MVI) in patients with preserved liver function (2–4). Notwith- standing, some specialized centers have reported using transarterial radioembolization (TARE) to treat patients with HCC-MVI (5,6). TARE has been found safe and effective across various stages of HCC in prospective trials and retrospective studies (7–11). However, its superiority over the standard of care in terms of overall survival (OS) has not been shown in pa- tients with HCC-MVI. Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs), Sorafenib versus Radioembolization in Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma (SARAH) (12) and Selective Internal Radiation Therapy versus Sorafenib in Asia-Paciﬁc Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma (SIRveNIB) (13), compared TARE with sorafenib for advanced HCC. No survival advantage of either treatment was identiﬁed in these trials; however, both involved heterogeneous cohorts not limited to those with MVI. Furthermore, neither was adequately powered to support subgroup analyses. A trial speciﬁcally focused on HCC-MVI (Efﬁcacy Evaluation of TheraSphere to Treat Inoperable Liver Cancer With Blockage of the Portal Vein (YES-P), NCT01887717) was initiated but closed prematurely because of poor accrual (14). As questions regarding the optimal treatment of HCC- MVI remain unanswered, this study analyzed the National Cancer Database (NCDB) to examine the efﬁcacy of TARE in this context, taking advantage of several statistical methods to address the forms of bias that may affect observational studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study Endpoint, Cohort, and Objective The main objective was to compare the observational endpoint of OS between TARE-treated and systemically treated patients with HCC-MVI balanced on other clinically relevant covariates. Data Collection Institutional review board approval under 45 CFR 46.110 and 21 CFR 56.110 was granted to access the NCDB participant user ﬁle. Only cases diagnosed from 2010 to 2015 were included because clinical and follow-up data were complete only for those years at the time of the anal- ysis. To avoid confounding, cases involving multiple cancer diagnoses were excluded. HCC was identiﬁed using the International Classiﬁcation of Disease—Oncology, third edition, histology code 8170, with major vascular involve- ment (ie, HCC-MVI) further identiﬁed based on cancer stage and extent in accordance` with the American Joint Commission on Cancer, seventh edition, staging system that deﬁnes MVI as an invasion of the branches of the main portal vein or 1 or more hepatic veins. The resulting dataset included 6,211 cases of HCC-MVI. Of these, 421 patients were identiﬁed as initially treated with TARE and 1,939 patients as initially treated with single-agent systemic therapy. All other patients, including those initially treated with locoregional therapy or with a combination of TARE and systemic therapy, were excluded (Fig 1). Immunotherapy, which did not receive approval in the United States until 2017 and comprised the initial treatment in 0.46 % of the screened cases, was not considered a systemic therapy for the study’s purpose. Among those remaining, 117 and 729 were excluded from the TARE-treated and systemically treated patients, respec- tively, because of missing laboratory data, with no signiﬁ- cant differences noted between the cases excluded and those not excluded, except for higher proportions of the Charlson- Deyo comorbidity score (CDCS) >0 among cases remain- ing in both the treatment groups (P ¼ .043 and .002, respectively). The resulting dataset before matching comprised 304 TARE-treated and 1,210 systemically treated patients with no missing data (Fig 1). Statistical Methods Statistical methods are described in Appendix A (available online on the article’s Supplemental Material page at www. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS � The National Cancer Database was used to compare outcomes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with macrovascular invasion after transarterial radi- oembolization (TARE) versus systemic therapy. Propensity score matching (PSM), landmark anal- ysis, and target trial emulation (TTE) were used, with 484 patients selected for PSM and 142 for TTE. � In PSM analysis, TARE resulted in a median overall survival (OS) of 7.1 months, compared with 4.9 months for systemic therapy, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.74. � In the TTE, TARE resulted in a median OS of 12.9 months compared with 6.5 months, with a HR of 0.57. STUDY DETAILS Study type: Retrospective, observational, cohort study Volume 32 ▪ Number 9 ▪ September ▪ 2021 1259  jvir.org.) Because OS is measured by the NCDB from the diagnosis date, the time to treatment is tantamount to a guaranteed period of survival. This potential source of guarantee-time bias was addressed by placing a conditional landmark at 60 days, with landmark sensitivity assessed at 30 and 90 days (15). Covariate Selection and Treatment Propensity Modeling Applying a causal framework (16), the following covariates were prospectively chosen to model treatment propensity: age, sex, diagnosis year, facility type, CDCS, creatinine level (mg/dL), bilirubin level (mg/dL), international normalized ratio (INR), alpha-fetoprotein range, tumor focality, lobar extent, and maximum unidimensional size. The propensity model included diagnosis year to account for changing treatment availability and overall improved cancer care over time. The included laboratory values are relevant to both the treatment and prognosis of liver disease. CDCS, ranging from 0 (no comorbidities) to 3 (high comorbidity), substituted for oncologic performance status (17). Pro- pensity scores were calculated using logistic regression, and matching was completed using the nearest-neighbor tech- nique, 3:1 maximum ratio, no replacement, and 0.1 caliper (18). The covariate balance criterion was a standardized mean difference of <0.1. Target Trial Emulation Target trial emulation (TTE) has been described in recent publications (16,19). YES-P, an RCT initiated in 2014 and prematurely terminated in 2017, provided a reasonable target trial because it was designed to compare TARE with sorafenib in patients with portal vein invasion (20). The TTE study design, including intention to treat (ITT), eligi- bility criteria, treatment arms, and causal estimands, is described in Appendix A (available online at www.jvir.org.) In brief, TTE involved patients aged >18 years with American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) stage 3B treatment- naive HCC-MVI, total bilirubin level <2.0 mg/dL, INR <1.7, creatinine level <2.0 mg/dL, CDCS 0 or 1, unilobular disease, and no extrahepatic extension. Because randomi- zation dates are nonexistent for TTE, diagnosis dates pro- vided the start times for survival analysis. RESULTS Descriptive and Multivariable Analysis The patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Sex distribution conﬁrmed HCC male preponderance (21). Signiﬁcantly more TAREs were performed at academic or research facilities. TARE was part of initial HCC treatment in 7.14 % of advanced cases in 2010 and 15.9 % in 2015. Figure 1. Study ﬂowchart diagram. HCC ¼ hepatocellular carcinoma; TARE ¼ transarterial radioembolization. 1260 ▪ Emulated Target Trial for Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma Kwee et al ▪ JVIR  TARE was the only treatment that increased in usage year after year (Fig 2). Mean time between diagnosis and treatment with TARE and systemic therapy was 66.5 days ± 47.5 and 46.8 days ± 45.7, respectively (P < .0001). Among censored patients, mean follow-up interval was 34.3 months ± 21.8 for those treated with TARE and 36.6 months ± 28.3 (P ¼ .54) for those treated with systemic therapy. In multivariable Cox regression analysis (Table 2), higher mortality was signiﬁcantly associated with bilirubin level, INR, an alpha-fetoprotein level of 400 ng/mL or higher, and a tumor size of 50 mm or greater. Signiﬁcantly lower mortality was associated with unifocal tumors, treat- ment with TARE, and treatment at noncommunity cancer programs. The overall ﬁt of a multivariable model that included 2-way treatment interactions did not differ signif- icantly from that of the main-effects model. Propensity Score Matching Matching produced a cohort of 144 TARE-treated and 344 systemically treated patients, with all covariate standardized mean differences below 0.1 (Fig 3). Emulating the effects of randomization, the postmatch propensity score distribution was nearly identical (Fig 4). Survival Analysis TARE was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.74 (95 % CI, 0.60–0.91; P ¼ .005) in Cox regression analysis with a 60-day landmark. The median OS was 7.1 months (95 % CI, 5.0–10.5) with TARE and 4.9 months (95 % CI, 3.9–6.5) with systemic therapy (Fig 5a). Signiﬁcantly improved OS was also found in a sensitivity analysis using a 30-day landmark (HR 0.49 [95 % CI, 0.31–0.76; P ¼ .002]; median OS, 11.7 months [95 % CI, 7.4–22.8] vs 3.9 months [95 % CI, 2.9–6.2]) and a 90-day landmark (HR, 0.77 [95 % CI, 0.65–0.92; P ¼ .004]; median OS, 6.7 months [95 % CI, 5.4–9.9] vs 5.4 months [95 % CI, 4.5– 6.7]). TTE The cohort was reduced to 236 patients after applying trial selection criteria. The effects of selection on the sample size are summarized in Appendix A (available online at www. jvir.org.) Propensity score matching produced a matched cohort of 50 TARE-treated and 92 systemically treated pa- tients (Fig 1). In a 60-day landmark analysis, TARE was associated with an HR of 0.57 (95 % CI, 0.39–0.83; P ¼ .004). The median OS was 12.9 months (95 % CI, 7.6–19.2) with TARE and 6.5 months (95 % CI, 3.6–11.1) with sys- temic treatment (Fig 5b). In a landmark sensitivity analysis, the HR was 0.65 (95 % CI, 0.50–0.85; P ¼ .002), with a median OS of 13.4 months (95 % CI, 8.8–18.9) versus 6.0 months (95 % CI, 5.1–9.8) using a 30-day landmark. The HR was 0.72 (95 % CI, 0.52–1.01; P ¼ .06), with a median OS of 13.2 months (95 % CI, 6.6–19.3) versus 8.9 months (95 % CI, 4.2–14.2) using a 90-day landmark. DISCUSSION Several centers have reported increasing institutional expe- rience in using TARE as the primary treatment for inter- mediate and advanced stages of HCC (5,6,22–24). The present study conﬁrmed this to be a national trend for HCC- MVI even though an RCT comparing TARE with the standard of care has never been completed in this patient population. In propensity-score–matched analyses using the NCDB data, TARE was found to be associated with Table 1.

However, because these ﬁndings were based on observational data, they require careful interpretation and consideration along with any available data from prospective trials that may have included patients with HCC-MVI. In the SARAH RCT that involved a heterogeneous pa- tient cohort, the endpoint of OS was found not to differ signiﬁcantly between patients assigned to TARE or sor- afenib. However, TARE was associated with longer delays between randomization and treatment (mean, 21 vs 3 days). From 237 patients assigned to TARE on an ITT basis, 53 (22 %) ultimately did not undergo TARE, including 8 who progressed after randomization and 26 who ultimately received sorafenib (12). In contrast, 216 of 222 patients (97 %) assigned to sorafenib were treated as planned. Similarly, in the SIRveNIB trial, the mean time between randomization and treatment was 29 days for TARE and 7 days for sorafenib (13). Of 182 patients assigned to TARE, 52 (29 %) were precluded, including 24 with excessive hepatopulmonary shunting and 5 with unfavorable angio- graphic ﬁndings, whereas 162 of 178 patients (91 %) assigned to sorafenib were treated as planned (13). Considering that these were ITT trials, such imbalances likely exerted a negative impact on the measured survival beneﬁts of TARE. The present study also found longer de- lays to TARE treatment; however, for the observational survival analysis, these time differences were readily addressed through a landmark analysis (15,25). The study ﬁnding that TARE, nonetheless, was associated with improved OS is encouraging, given that treatments for advanced HCC are not expected to prolong survival beyond several months (26–28). Further supporting TARE in this patient population, a recent meta-analysis involving SARAH, SIRveNIB, and SORAMIC (Sorafenib and Micro- therapy Guided by Primovist Enhanced MRI in Patients With Inoperable Liver Cancer, a trial comparing TARE plus sorafenib with sorafenib alone) data found TARE non- inferior to sorafenib overall, potentially superior in non- cirrhotic patients and patients with hepatitis B, and associated with signiﬁcantly fewer treatment-related adverse events in patients with advanced HCC with or without MVI (28). However, treatment dosimetry in these trials was based on the empiric, body surface area or Medical Internal Ra- diation Dosimetry (MIRD) models currently approved for clinical practice. As planning before treatment becomes more efﬁcient and incorporates more advanced and indi- vidualized methods of dosimetry, TARE efﬁcacy and safety should improve further (29–31). This study has several limitations. One limitation is the possibility that the treatment propensity modeling did not Figure 2.

Transarterial radioembolization was the only treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma that increased in usage every year. TARE ¼ transarterial radioembolization. 1262 ▪ Emulated Target Trial for Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma Kwee et al ▪ JVIR  account for all relevant sources of selection bias. However, the NCDB did adequately supply the propensity model with factors most strongly inﬂuencing survival outcome and treatment selection in patients with HCC, including labo- ratory parameters—such as bilirubin, creatinine, and pro- thrombin time—that impact both liver disease severity and eligibility for TARE. Even though all the data sought for the propensity model were available, the NCDB did lack certain details, including TARE-speciﬁc information such as the speciﬁc embolic agent used, catheter position, and radiation dose distribution. Analyzing such factors might have pro- duced additional insights because complete tumor targeting and absorbed radiation dose to the tumor appear to be in- dependent predictors of progression-free survival and OS in TARE-treated intermediate- and advanced-stage HCCs (29). Because TARE implementation is heterogeneous across institutions, this lack of detail limits this study to estimating only the average treatment effect, without enabling further insights related to TARE delivery. Nonetheless, the study ﬁndings may be encouraging for patients faced with making a decision between TARE and systemic therapy. The overall efﬁcacy of TARE may also further increase as patient-individualized treatment dosimetry gains traction in clinical practice (29–31). In this regard, the present study provides a baseline performance estimate for examining improvements in clinical TARE over time. The NCDB also contains few details about systemic therapy, although sor- afenib would be the systemic agent most used for advanced HCC between 2010 and 2015. Another limitation of this study was that the available data comprised only an isolated period of time. Systemic therapy for patients with HCC has evolved substantially in recent years and now includes combined immune-checkpoint and angiogenesis inhibition as a ﬁrst-line treatment option (32). Considering this evo- lution, this study will mainly serve as a historical account of the potential clinical beneﬁt and increasing use of TARE during a time when all clinical guidelines considered sys- temic therapy with a multikinase inhibitor as the standard of care for advanced HCC. However, by identifying potential beneﬁts from this previous era, this study helps carry the impetus forward in supporting TARE as an alternative to systemic therapy and provides a justiﬁcation for future studies to compare or combine it with immunotherapy and other contemporary regimens for advanced HCC. To date, a clinical trial comparing TARE with systemic therapy has not been completed successfully in patients with HCC-MVI. To address this knowledge gap, TTE was per- formed based on the published protocol of YES-P, an un- completed RCT for HCC-MVI, adapting its design and analysis plan in an effort to mitigate potential biases that may arise from a misalignment between an observational data analysis and the ideal analysis engendered by a target trial (25,33). In factoring ITT into this analysis, the over- estimations of survival beneﬁt that could have arisen from a per-protocol analysis were avoided while recognizing the role of systemic therapy as the standard of care for patients with HCC-MVI. The association of TARE with improved OS in a pragmatic analysis comprising the real-world spectrum of patients with HCC-MVI suggests that future clinical trials of TARE in patients with advanced HCC can consider less restrictive eligibility criteria, especially because YES-P was terminated because of poor accrual. Other recent observational data analyses have indicated that careful broadening of the eligibility criteria could lead to greater patient participation, equity, and external validity in oncology trials (34). With newer agents now approved for ﬁrst-line treatment of advanced HCC (32), a prospective trial comparing TARE with multikinase inhibitors is no longer timely. The present challenge will be to design and conduct a study comparing a contemporary ﬁrst-line systemic regimen (such as an immune-checkpoint inhibitor plus an antiangiogenic agent) with ﬁrst-line TARE (optimized using voxel-based or other personalized dosimetry with streamlined planning before treatment) or their combination in cohorts selected using eligibility criteria that support brisk trial enrollment and external validity. Furthermore, although OS has tradition- ally been used as a trial endpoint for supporting regulatory approval, the increasing number of second-line and Table 2.

It may become increasingly difﬁcult to estimate the clinical beneﬁts of ﬁrst-line treat- ments in terms of OS as second-line treatment strategies evolve and increase in effectiveness. The present study provides observational evidence in pragmatic and target trial cohorts that ﬁrst-line TARE can impact OS in patients with HCC-MVI and gives estimates on the treatment effect size and impact of trial selection criteria to justify and inform future trials. The larger improvement in OS observed in the emulated trial suggests that TARE can particularly beneﬁt patients with HCC-MVI and unilobar disease.

References Cited in Appendix A GENERAL STATISTICAL AND MATCHED SURVIVAL ANALYSIS Differences between continuous variables were tested using analysis of variance or the Kruskall-Wallis test. The chi- square test with continuity correction was used to deter- mine differences in proportions. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were assessed using log-rank tests. Hazard ratios and 95 % CIs were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression. Multivariable Cox analysis was performed with and without 2-way interactions, with differences in model ﬁt tested using the likelihood ratio test. Proportionality was conﬁrmed using Schoenfeld residuals. Statistical signiﬁ- cance was based on 2-sided P <.05. The analyses were conducted using SAS Studio 3.8 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina) and R 3.6.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The R packages “matchit” and “cobalt” were used for propensity score matching and bal- ance assessment, respectively (Appendix References 1-3). UNMATCHED SURVIVAL ANALYSIS The Kaplan-Meier curves comparing overall survival (OS) between transarterial radioembolization (TARE)-treated and systemically treated patients in the unmatched raw cohort (n ¼ 1,514) are shown in Figure E1 (available online on the article’s Supplemental Material page at www.jvir.org.) The median survival was 9.7 months (95 % CI, 8.4–12.3) for the TARE-treated group versus 6.5 months (95 % CI, 6.1–7.2) for the systemically treated group (P < .0001). However, the treatment groups in this unmatched cohort showed a lack of balance in multiple covariates (Fig 3), and the results of a well-balanced, propensity-score– matched pragmatic analysis were more modest yet signif- icant. Although in this study, the results did not differ greatly between the matched and unmatched analyses, the potential for a bias inherent to a poorly matched observa- tional cohort analysis limits conﬁdence in the precision of the results of the latter, and in other cases, such analyses have resulted in exaggerated estimates of the treatment effect (35–37). The use of propensity score balancing in this study increases conﬁdence in the precision of the observed effect on outcome. EMULATED TARGET TRIAL PROTOCOL Overview This emulated target trial (ETT) was designed to approxi- mate the clinical trial design elements of an industry- sponsored Phase III, prospective, randomized clinical trial titled “90Yttrium Trans-Arterial Radio-Embolization (TARE) vs. Standard of Care (Chemotherapy) for the Treatment of Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) with Portal Vein Thrombosis” (YES-P, ID NCT01887717). Because this trial was closed before completion, no results or data from this trial are available in the clinicaltrials.gov record. Protocol Design The ETT is a 2-arm observational data analysis using pro- pensity-score–matched cohorts drawn from the U.S. Na- tional Cancer Database (NCDB). The actual target trial protocol (ATTP) that served as the template for this ETT was based on NCT01887717, downloaded from clinicaltrials.gov (YES-P Protocol v3.0 HCC Phase III Protocol TS-104, dated 2014/08/08) (20). ETT Study Objective To assess the efﬁcacy of TARE in comparison with that of the standard of care (chemotherapy) for the treatment of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated with major vascular invasion. Primary Endpoint Overall survival (OS from the date of diagnosis. Treatment Arms The ATTP was an industry-sponsored, multicenter, Phase III randomized controlled trial that required speciﬁc drug agents for the treatment and control arms. The speciﬁc agent used for the experimental arm was TheraSphere (yttrium-90 glass microspheres, BTG plc, London, United Kingdom), and the speciﬁc agent used for the control arm was Nexavar (sorafenib, Bayer HealthCare, Whippany, NJ). In contrast, the ETT is a nationwide observational data analysis comparing 2 classes of therapeutic agents, TARE (for which TheraSphere is a speciﬁc agent) and chemotherapy (for which sorafenib is a speciﬁc agent). Both are currently being used in clinical practice to treat advanced HCC. A pro- prietary or speciﬁc therapeutic agent, either approved or investigational, has not been speciﬁed for the ETT. The arms of the ETT are deﬁned as follows: The control arm of the ETT received single-agent sys- temic therapy, the standard of care for advanced-stage Volume 32 ▪ Number 9 ▪ September ▪ 2021 1266.e1  HCC, as recommended by the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease and the European Association for the Study of the Liver guidelines. In the NCDB, this control arm was identiﬁed based on treatment codes signifying single-agent chemotherapy as the ﬁrst course of treatment. The treatment arm of the ETT was deﬁned as that receiving an intra-arterial radioisotopic injection for the purpose of embolizing the tumor or a tumor-affected hepatic segment or lobe to deliver interstitial brachytherapy. The Commission on Cancer accredited institutions participating in the NCDB and employed multiple codes under the radiation treatment modality to identify TARE (brachy- therapy, low-dose rate interstitial or not otherwise speciﬁed, or radioisotope). Treatment Crossover With the exception of patients who progressed clinically while on sorafenib, the ATTP allowed patients assigned to 1 arm to cross over to the other arm, if clinically warranted (eg, a patient did not tolerate their assigned treatment). In keeping with the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle, these patients remained in their originally assigned arms for analysis. The data recorded in the NCDB allows this crossover rule to be applied in the ETT (see the “Causal Estimands” section). Treatment Timing The ATTP speciﬁed that the control arm be treated within 2 weeks of randomization and the treatment arm be treated within 3 weeks. Because the date of diagnosis serves as a surrogate for the date of randomization in the ETT, it would not have been feasible to apply such treatment time win- dows in the ETT analysis. A series of conditional landmark analyses were performed covering 30, 60, and 90 days from the start of follow-up. Eligibility Criteria The eligibility criteria for the ATTP and their corresponding translations for the ETT are shown in Table E1 (available online on the article’s Supplemental Material page at www.jvir.org.) Identical criteria were not absolutely required for target trial emulation. Criteria deemed not essential or not translatable by variables available from the NCDB are indicated as “No corresponding criteria.” None of the un- mapped criteria were determined to be crucial for meeting the study objectives of the ETT. Method for Assigning Patients to the Treatment Groups The ATTP involved a trial site randomization at a 1:1 ratio, with stratiﬁcation based on an alpha-fetoprotein level of >400 ng/mL. The ETT took advantage of an almost 3-fold larger number of chemotherapy-treated patients by per- forming a pseudorandomization (ie, propensity score matching) at up to 3:1 ratio to increase statistical power. In lieu of stratiﬁcation, propensity score matching included covariate balancing based on an alpha-fetoprotein level of �400 ng/mL. Blinding The ATTP did not involve blinding. Determination of Sample Size The ATTP stated that the study was designed to detect a 4- month increase in the median OS time from 9 months in the control arm to 13 months in the treatment arm (ie, hazard ratio, 0.69) using a log-rank test. An estimated 250 subjects yielded 80 % power to detect this target difference with a 2- sided alpha value of 0.05. Evaluations and Study Visits These were not applicable to the ETT because they would have only evaluated the primary endpoint of OS. Time Points The ATTP deﬁned the ﬁrst day of follow-up as the date of randomization. Because there is no date of randomization for an ETT, the default date of diagnosis, as recorded in the NCDB participant user ﬁle, served as the baseline date for calculating the time to event (ie, ﬁrst day of follow-up). When it was necessary to convert the units of months into those of days, the following formula was used: Days ¼ Months � 365.25/12. Causal Estimands The ATTP implements an ITT basis but includes both ITT and per-protocol analyses. This approach is also feasible for the ETT: for the chemotherapy arm of the ETT, the ITT principle is implicit because the natural discontinuation rate of chemotherapy is reﬂected in the NCDB time-to-event data, given the manner in which the ﬁrst course of treatment is recorded. Because the ATTP selection criteria were intended to screen out patients who would not be qualiﬁed to receive chemotherapy, patients randomized into the chemotherapy arm were highly likely to receive treatment as planned (as was also observed in the Selective Internal Radiation Therapy versus Sorafenib in Asia-Paciﬁc Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Sorafenib versus Radioembolization in Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma trials), but this is not an ab- solute requirement for an ITT analysis. The measured time-to-treatment interval was also relatively short in the chemotherapy arm, with the data expected to reﬂect a negligible amount of fallout due to disease progression. For the TARE arm of the ETT, discontinuation following the initiation of treatment was not relevant because TARE was delivered as a same-day treatment, usually all at once (on some occasions, 2 times). A more serious issue with regard to emulating the ITT principle is the higher 1266.e2 ▪ Emulated Target Trial for Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma Kwee et al ▪ JVIR  likelihood of TARE being cancelled compared with chemotherapy. Therefore, in order to adhere to the ITT principle, patients in whom radiation treatment was rec- ommended or planned but not ultimately performed were identiﬁed and included in the TARE arm. Because the clinical alternative to TARE is chemotherapy and because the ATTP did allow for treatment crossover from the TARE group, it was appropriate to identify such patients from among the sorafenib-treated group drawn from the NCDB. These patients can be identiﬁed using the REASON_FOR_NO_RADIATION variable recorded in the participant user ﬁle. To simulate the ITT, these patients were excluded from the chemotherapy group and added to the TARE group prior to propensity score matching and out- comes analysis. Efﬁcacy The primary efﬁcacy variable is OS, deﬁned as the time from the baseline date to the date of death due to any cause, calculable using DX_LASTCONTACT_DEATH_- MONTHS. No secondary efﬁcacy variables were evaluated by the ETT. Adverse Events and Quality of Life Because only the primary outcome was evaluated, no adverse event or quality-of-life data were analyzed by the ETT. Statistical Plan The statistical analysis plan is described in the “General Statistical and Matched Survival Analysis” section of this document and in the primary manuscript. ETT COHORT SIZES AFTER APPLYING SELECTION CRITERIA The effects of applying speciﬁc selection criteria on the ETT cohort size are shown in Table E2 (available online on the article’s Supplemental Material page at www.jvir.org.) ETT BALANCE DIAGNOSTICS After propensity score matching, the ETT cohort became well balanced (standardized mean differences of <0.01 for all covariates), emulating the effects of randomization. The covariate balance plot for this cohort is shown in Figure E2 (available online on the article’s Supplemental Material page at www.jvir.org.) REFERENCES CITED IN APPENDIX A 1.
